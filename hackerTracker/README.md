# Hacker Tracker demo

This is a demo that uses a downloaded copy of the hacker tracker data from the [Hacker Tracker](https://hackertracker.net/) website.  We then parse that data into a locally running LLM and allow anyone of the DEFCON Meshtastic network to query the data and get information about when and where different events and talks are happening.

The data is pulled from [DEFCON 33 Downloads](https://defcon.outel.org/dcwp/dc33/downloads/) and is updated manually.  So this is not a live feed of the data, but rather a snapshot of the data at the time of the download.
