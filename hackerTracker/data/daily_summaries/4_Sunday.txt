Please note: This two-day training will be offered on Saturday and Sunday (August 9-10). Participants will receive a DEF CON Human Badge with their registration

It is indeed all about the information. Information is powerâand those who control it hold the reins. This course dives deep into the topic of Influence Operations (IO), teaching you how adversaries manipulate, deceive, and control the flow of information to achieve their objectives. From destabilizing governments to swaying elections and ruining careers, IO is a tool used by state and non-state actors alike. The question is, how do you defend against it?

In this fast-paced, hands-on course, weâll break down how IO is planned, executed, and defended against. Youâll gain the skills and knowledge to not only recognize and counteract these operations but to protect yourself, your organization, and even your country from their impact.

What You'll Learn:


IO Strategies & Tactics: From the basics to advanced techniques, understand how influence operations shape public opinion, corporate behavior, and political landscapes.
Psychological Operations (PSYOP): Explore the manipulation of biases, emotions, perceptions, and actions to control outcomes.
Deception and Counterdeception: Learn how deception campaigns are crafted, and how to spot and disrupt them.
Military Doctrine & TTPs: Understand military frameworks for IO and adapt them for defending against threats.
Incident Response & Defensive Tactics: Equip yourself with practical strategies for detecting and defending against IO campaigns targeting individuals and organizations.
Crafting Messages & Understanding Propagation: Learn the art of creating and spreading messages to achieve specific goalsâwhile also learning how to counter malicious ones.
Real-World Case Studies: From deceptive news to social media manipulation, analyze recent IO campaigns to understand their impact and develop defensive strategies.
Live IO Campaign Contest: Compete in a live âbest IO campaignâ contest, applying the techniques youâve learned during the course to test your strategies. 


By the end of the course, youâll not only have a deep understanding of how IO is executed, but you'll also walk away with practical tools to defend against these attacks. Youâll learn how to recognize the signs of manipulation, understand the motivations behind IO, and develop countermeasures to protect against them.

In a world where information is weaponized, knowing how to protect yourself is no longer optional. Whether youâre securing yourself, an organization, protecting a political campaign, or defending a nation, this course is your toolkit for navigating the complex and increasingly dangerous world of influence operations.

Description:
Every watt and bit tells a story.

The concept of "smart grids" dates back to the 1970s with automatic meters, but the term emerged with the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. Since 2012, the integration of smart grids and Cloud computing has been a topic at IEEE meetings. This raises key questions: How do we assess risks to physical and virtual infrastructure? What are the impacts of a breach? Where does digital forensics fit in?

Since 2017, the Cloud Forensics Workshop has introduced security professionals to core Cloud forensics concepts. The latest Smart Grid Edition explores the relationship between smart grids, Cloud computing, and digital forensics. Participants will engage in hands-on labs using open-source tools to identify indicators of compromise (IoCs), acquire forensically sound artifacts, and apply AI and automation in investigations. Registered students will download sample data before the workshop and apply their skills in a live tabletop exercise.

Description:
Did you ever wanted to hack an IoT device but did not know how to start? Having UART is nice, but does not help in many cases.

For a complete analysis of an IoT device, it is required to look at the firmware itself. In most cases this means that the firmware, data or encryption keys need to be extracted from the device memory. Many researchers are hesitant to do that as there is a high risk of destroying the device or leaving it in an inoperable state. In this workshop we will look at different flash memory types (EEPROM, SPI flash, NAND flash, eMMC flash) and how to extract the information from them.

We will show that you do not need very expensive hardware to archive your goal and that it is not as complicated as everyone believes. See which tools might be useful for your own lab!

Participants will have the opportunity to work in groups and being provided different kinds of IoT devices (e.g. smart speakers). After a tear-down, you can use different chip-off methods (e.g. Hot air, IR soldering) to remove the flash chip and read it out. Optionally, the tools re-ball and re-solder the IC will be available after the workshop. In the end, each team should have the data and a functional device again.

Bonus: If you brick the device, you can keep the parts as a souvenir or can wear them as badges.

Description:
EMMC is a common flash memory format for more complex embedded devices and the Ball Grid Array (BGA) is a popular format for EMMC modules. BGA modules can be intimidating to hardware hackers since the pins are not exposed and are instead underneath the chip. This workshop will demonstrate and allow you to practice removing EMMC modules from an inexpensive circuit board using flux and a hot air station. The module will contain a Linux operating system and a Raspberry Pi. Workshop participants will learn how to image the removed EMMC. Mount and change the Linux filesystem in order to backdoor the image and gain access, and then learn how to copy the image to a new EMMC. Participants will then learn how to attach the module to a BGA carrier board with hot air.

A basic understanding of soldering is all that is required to be successful in this workshop. An understanding of the Linux filesystem is also helpful, but not required. We will have step by step instructions and will also have a small prize for the participant who comes up with and demonstrates the most clever Linux backdoor on their Raspberry Pi.

At the end of this workshop, participants will have an understanding of:
How to remove, clean and image BGA modules
Basics of offline Linux filesystem hacking
How to image and reattach BGA EMMC modules

Where: LVCCW-Level 1-W101-W102 - Map

Description:
Our human registration process this year will be very similar to previous years. Please be patient. All of the times listed here are approximate. 

Basics

Who needs a badge?

A badge is required for each human age 8 and older.

Human?

You are a human if you do not know otherwise. People that are not humans include goons, official speaker, village/community/contest/creator staff, press, black badge holders, or similar. If you are not a human, you need to register separately. If you don't know how, see an NFO goon (NFO Node, formerly known as an infobooth, is where you can get help). The remainder of this message applies only to humans.

Lines? Linecon?

Linecon is your optional opportunity to stand (or sit) in line for human registration to open. Doors will open for linecon on Wednesday at approximately 17:00. When human registration opens on Thursday at approximately 08:00, they start working the linecon queue, and the line will start moving quickly. (Please understand that we will begin processing the line on Thursday morning as soon as the cashiers and materials are in place; we will strive for Thursday 08:00, but actual start may be slightly earlier or later.)

Online badge purchase (aka pre-registration) has no impact on linecon. You can join the line on Wednesday (if you wish) regardless of whether you purchased a badge online or intend to pay with cash. There is only one linecon for both types of badge sales. 

Please help us make this a great experience for everyone by following directions given by goons. After human registration opens, there may be one line for all of registration, or there may be two lines (one for online sales (pre-registration) and one for cash sales). This may also change over time, based on available staffing and necessary crowd control. We will strive to make it easily understandable in-person as to which line you should join. 

Ways to buy a badge


$560 online purchase until July 18, 2025. Tickets are transferable. Please read the details on the linked page.
$580 online purchase until August 1, 2025. Tickets are transferable. Please read the details on the linked page.
$500 cash purchase on-site.
As part of a BlackHat registration.


Online Purchase

You will be emailed a QR code to the email address provided when you bought your badge. Please guard that QR code as though it is cash -- it can only be redeemed once, and anyone can redeem it if they have it (including a photo of it). Badges are picked-up on-site -- they will not be mailed or shipped.

We can scan the QR code either from your phone's display or from a printed copy. You must have the QR code with you in order to obtain your badge. As you approach the front of the line, if you are going to show your QR code on an electronic device, please ensure that your display is set to maximum brightness. 

If you pre-registered, but ultimately are unable to attend DEF CON and want to cancel your purchase, the only way to get a refund is from the original online source. We are unable to provide any refunds on-site at DEF CON. There is a fee to have your badge canceled: $34 before July 18, and $84 on and after July 18.

Online purchases are provided a receipt via email when the purchase is made.

Online purchase -- often referred to as pre-registration -- does not allow you to skip any line/queue to pick up your badge. Once you arrive on-site, you will need to join the existing line for human registration. There may or may not be a dedicated line for pre-registration badge pickup, depending on when you arrive, how long the line is, available staff, etc.

Cash Purchase

Badges will be available for purchase on-site at DEF CON. All badge sales are cash only. No checks, money orders, credit cards, etc., will be accepted. In order to keep the registration line moving as quickly as possible, please have exact change ready as you near the front of the line.

There are no refunds given for cash sales. If you have any doubt about your desire to buy a badge, please refrain from doing so.

We are unable to provide printed receipts at the time of the sale. A generic receipt for the cash sale of a badge will be made available on media.defcon.org after the conference. You are welcome to print your own copy of the receipt on plain paper.

Via BlackHat

If you've purchased a DEF CON badge as part of your Black Hat registration, you're in luck - you will be able to pick up your DEF CON badge at Black Hat on Thursday.  Please bring your Black Hat badge and watch for emails from Black Hat about where exactly the badge pickup will be.  There will be DEF CON goons at Mandalay at the pickup desk to help out and answer questions.

Please note that DEF CON is not able to access or verify Black Hat registration or attendee info.  DEF CON's preregistration list is not the same as Black Hat's.  For help, ask at Black Hat registration or the concierge area. 

Misc

Want to buy multiple badges? No problem! We're happy to sell you however many badges you want to pay for.

If you lose your badge, there is unfortunately no way for us to replace it. You'll have to buy a replacement at full price. Please don't lose your badge. :( 

If you are being accompanied by a full-time caretaker (such as someone who will push your wheelchair, and will accompany you at all times), please ask to speak to a Registration Goon. Your caretaker will receive a paper badge that will permit them to accompany you everywhere you go.

Still need help?

If you have questions about anything regarding human registration that are not addressed here, please ask to speak to a Registration Goon.

Choose your side!

Blue Team
You are assigned to the Cybersecurity Team servicing four Regional Airports within the IG Labs Regional Airport System. The shift this evening started with routine checking status boards, reviewing threat alerts, and checking for any newly identified vulnerabilities that may have an impact on the system from both Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) vectors.

Around midnight, chaos ensues! Runway lighting is turning off at your airport and others nearby, planes are circling waiting to land or diverting to other locations. You must regain access to your systems, find the problem, and restore operation to the Runway Lighting Control System quickly and ensure that the other regional airports your team is responsible for do not lose control of their systems and operations are able to continue without interruption.

Red Team(s)
Cybersecurity Teams are often heavily focused on securing Information Technology (IT) systems and devices but may not consider securing Operational Technology (OT) systems and devices. While OT systems and devices may be connected to IT systems, the type of data and protocols are different.

You start your day exploring OT system vulnerabilities and consider what chaos you could create. You see a report that the runway lighting system at one of the IG Labs Regional Airports has been compromised. You start researching to learn more about the attack and the IG Labs Regional Airport System. Satisfied that you have learned enough to add to the madness that has been created at La Valoria, you decide to launch an attack of your own.

Success will be determined by the ability to disrupt the control and operations of the Runway Lighting Systems for the IG Labs Regional Airports at the OT level. DoS and DDoS attacks are not permitted as the intent is to demonstrate an understanding of OT systems, their functionality, and protocols.

You all know that PLC4TRUCKS is unintentionally accessible wirelessly (CVEs 2020-14514 and 2022-26131). In this talk we will dig into the details of the new CVE-2024-12054 and some other results on the ECU investigated. This talk is tailored to those with an automotive cybersecurity background.
We found ECUs running the KWP2000 diagnostic protocol on PLC4TRUCKS, supposedly secured with their fancy seed-key exchange. But guess what? Those seeds are way more predictable than they should be. A bit of timing trickery, a classic reset attack, and boom â we're in, no peeking at the ECU's responses needed. Blind, non-contact attacks on PLC4TRUCKS? Yep, we found a way. Turns out wireless unauthorized diagnostics access isn't just limited to older equipment. These newer trailer brake controllers' diagnostic functions can be abused too. This situation highlights the need for future tractors to deploy mitigations that protect the trailer from wireless attacks because they are all reachable and even the new ones are vulnerable.

Description:
Storm-2372 (Febâ25) has been virtually ignored, even though Russian threat actors demonstrated in-the-wild exploits using OAuth Device Code Phishing (Syynimaa, Octâ20) and PRT/device registration abuse (Moller, Octâ23) that fundamentally puts all Entra customers at risk via its abuse of OAuth, the device registration service, SSO and compromise of the Primary Refresh Token.

This talk starts with Mollerâs original research and compares the API calls and logging for valid device registration flows against the original and other expected attack variants including non-device code OAuth, non-phishing attacks, and endpoint compromise.

Weâll then look at additional implications of the attack, look at on-the-wire payloads, then focus on the challenge of effective detection by going through published best practices with detecting off of Entra sign-in logs, what may or may not be blocked by conditional access policies, where continuous access evaluation helps or not, and what is detected by Sentinel and Cloud Defender.

We will demo the attack, show API payloads, confuse ourselves with logs, using native Microsoft functionality and try to answer what can and canât be done effectively against this attack. Along the way weâll rant about what makes detection (and prevention) so difficult based on the design of Entra, its logs, and native tooling.

Rebooted this year, enjoy a traditional fox hunt tracking down the hidden transmitters.

Up for more of a challenge? Attempt to solve the hidden puzzle within the fox hunt to win the ultimate prize!

--

PROJECT ACCESS: A Fox Hunt in the Shadows

The last surviving fragments of Project ACCESS, a defunct open comms initiative, have resurfaced. The faceless OmniCorp thought they had erased it from the spectrum, but rogue operatives are pushing back. Disguised among the DEF CON crowd, Foxes are carrying the pieces needed to reboot the system.

Theyâre broadcasting open signals across the con space. Your job? Track them down, follow the trail, and recover the payloads. Some Foxes are stationary. Others are on the move. All of them have something you needâbut they wonât just hand it over. Youâll have to answer DEF CON trivia, solve puzzles, or earn their trust in creative ways.

This isnât a gear-only hunt. Whether youâre rocking SDRs, handheld radios, or just tuned into the right frequency, youâve got a shot. Itâs part signal chase, part real-world goose chase, and 100% hacker weirdness.

Expect:
- Live human Foxes broadcasting short-range signals
- Some Foxes roaming the con floor hunt them down, respectfully
- DEF CON history questions, crypto puzzles, and maybe a social engineering twist or two
- Physical items or clues exchanged when you succeed
- No encryption. No gatekeeping. Just old school radio and clever chaos.

Think you can track the signal, crack the code, and restore the last breath of open access?

Then grab your gear, tune in, and start hunting.

Participant Prerequisites

RF Fox Hunt(s): To participate in the RF fox hunt(s), you will need a radio or scanner that can receive signals in the 2m and/or 70cm Amateur Radio Bands (144.000 MHz - 148.000 MHz, 420.000 MHz - 450.000 MHz).

Something to read NFC cards.

In this game capture the flag you will be presented with real configurations of real wireless and radio technologies to attack. Practice your skill and learn new ones from Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) through Software Defined Radio (SDR) and up to Bluetooth and WiFi. There may even be Infrared, if you have the eye for it.

RF Hackers Sanctuary is once again holding the Radio Frequency Capture the Flag (RFCTF) at DEF CON 32. RFHS runs this game to teach security concepts and to give people a safe and legal way to practice attacks against new and old wireless technologies.

We cater to both those who are new to radio communications as well as to those who have been playing for a long time. We are looking for inexperienced players on up to the SIGINT secret squirrels to play our games. The RFCTF can be played with a little knowledge, a pen tester's determination, and $0 to $$$$$ worth of special equipment. Our virtual RFCTF can be played completely remotely without needing any specialized equipment at all, just using your web browser! The key is to read the clues, determine the goal of each challenge, and have fun learning.

This game doesn't let you sit still either, as there are numerous fox hunts, testing your skill in tracking various signals. If running around the conference looking for WiFi, Bluetooth, or even a Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) device sounds like fun, we are your source of a higher step count.

There will be clues everywhere, and we will provide periodic updates via discord and twitter. Make sure you pay attention to what's happening at the RFCTF desk, #rfctf on our discord, on Twitter @rf_ctf, @rfhackers, and the interwebz, etc. If you have a question - ASK! We may or may not answer, at our discretion.

Description:
Google's Privacy Sandbox initiative aims to provide privacy-preserving alternatives to third-party cookies by introducing new web APIs. This talk will examine potential client-side deanonymization attacks that can compromise user privacy by exploiting vulnerabilities and misconfigurations within these APIs. 

I will explore the Attribution Reporting API, detailing how debugging reports can bypass privacy mechanisms like Referrer-Policy, potentially exposing sensitive user information. I will also explain how destination hijacking, in conjunction with a side-channel attack using storage limit oracles, can be used to reconstruct browsing history, demonstrating a more complex deanonymization technique. 

Additionally, I will cover vulnerabilities in the Shared Storage API, illustrating how insecure cross-site worklet code can leak data stored within Shared Storage, despite the API being deliberately designed to prevent direct data access. Real-world examples and potential attack scenarios will be discussed to highlight the practical implications of these vulnerabilities.

The presentation will conclude by emphasizing the critical need for rigorous security and privacy research to ensure that Privacy Sandbox APIs effectively protect user data and achieve their intended privacy goals, given the complexity and potential for unintended consequences in their design and implementation.

Enigma was the infamous German encryption machines that was used in World War 2. A group of British cryptographers successfully broke the sophisticated machine, and in doing so, gave rise to modern adversarial cryptography and the Turing Machine, which would later evolve into the computer. In this workshop, we will look at how adversarial cryptography initially formed and how many of the techniques used still apply today. Additionally, many of the mathematical principles used in both the construction of the Enigma machine and its subsequent breaking are used heavily in modern encryption, which directly relate to the technology used in cryptocurrency.

Description:
Over the past two years, we have witnessed the emergence of a new class of attacks against LLM-powered systems known as Promptware.

Promptware refers to prompts (in the form of text, images, or audio samples) engineered to exploit LLMs at inference time to perform malicious activities within the application context.

While a growing body of research has already warned about a potential shift in the threat landscape posed to applications, Promptware has often been perceived as impractical and exotic due to the presumption that crafting such prompts requires specialized expertise in adversarial machine learning, a cluster of GPUs, and white-box access.

This talk will shatter this misconception forever.

In this talk, we introduce a new variant of Promptware called Targeted Promptware Attacks.

In these attacks, an attacker invites a victim to a Google Calendar meeting whose subject contains an indirect prompt injection.

By doing so, the attacker hijacks the application context, invokes its integrated agents, and exploits their permission to perform malicious activities.

We demonstrate 15 different exploitations of agent hijacking targeting the three most widely used Gemini for Workspace assistants: the web interface (www.gemini.google.com), the mobile application (Gemini for Mobile), and Google Assistant (which is powered by Gemini), which runs with OS permissions on Android devices.

We show that by sending a user an invitation for a meeting (or an email or sharing a Google Doc), attackers could hijack Geminiâs agents and exploit their tools to: Generate toxic content, perform spamming and phishing, delete a victim's calendar events, remotely control a victim's home appliances (connected windows, boiler, and lights), video stream a victim via Zoom, exfiltrate emails and calendar events, geolocate a victim, and launch a worm that tarets Gemini for Workspace clients.

Our demonstrations show that Promptware is capable to perform (1) inter-agent lateral movement (triggering malicious activity between different Gemini agents), and (2) inter-device lateral movement, escaping the boundaries of Gemini and leveraging applications installed on a victim's smartphone to perform malicious activities with physical outcomes (e.g., activating the boiler and lights or opening a window in a victim's apartment).

Finally, we assess the risk posed to end users using a dedicated threat analysis and risk assessment framework we developed.

Our findings indicate that 73% of the identified risks are classified as high-critical, requiring the deployment of immediate mitigations.

Description:
You may have heard tales of mainframe pentesting and exploitation before - mostly from us! Those stories often focused on the MVS/ISPF side of the IBM z/OS. But did you know that all those same tricks (and more!) can be pulled off in z/OS Unix System Services (OMVS) as well? I bet you didn't even know z/OS had a UNIX side!

Over the years we've discovered multiple unique attack paths when it comes to Unix on the mainframe. In this talk, we'll present live demos of real-world scenarios we've encountered during mainframe penetration tests. These examples will showcase what can happen with poor file hygiene leading to database compromises, inadequate file permissions enabling privilege escalation, lack of ESM resource understanding allowing for privileged command execution, and how dataset protection won't save you from these attacks. We'll also be demonstrating what can happen when we overflow the buffer in an APF authorized dataset.

Attendees will learn how to test these controls themselves using freely available open-source tools and how to (partially) detect these attacks. While privesc in UNIX isn't game over for your mainframe, it's pretty close. By the end, it will be clear that simply granting superuser access to Unix can be just as dangerous, if not more so, than giving access to TSO on the mainframe.

SpeakerBio:  Philip "Soldier of FORTRAN" Young
Philip Young, aka Soldier of FORTRAN, Director of Mainframe Penetration Testing Services at NetSPI is an oldschool hacker. He started out on with an Amiga 500 and a modem and never looked back, cutting his teeth on Datapac (the Canadian X.25 network) he eventually grew to searching the internet for interesting things. Later in his career he started taking a serious look at mainframe cybersecurity and realized how far behind mainframes had fallen when compared to their more open system (Windows/Linux). At that point he made it his lifes mission to raise awareness and produce tooling to aid in the testing of these critical resources to help keep them safe. Since then he has given talks around the world at places like BlackHat, DEFCON, RSA, has taught multiple workshops and was even under investigation by the Swedish secret police. In addition he has released countless opensources tools to pentest mainframes.

Description:
High-entropy ASLR was supposed to make bypasses of ASLR on Windows virtually impossible - until now! This talk will debut nine novel bypasses of the strongest form of ASLR on Windows, which makes attacks such as brute-forcing totally infeasible. This talk showcases how mostly simple, easy-to-find ROP gadgets can be used to construct highly reliable, universal ASLR bypasses to key Windows system DLLs, allowing ROP gadgets from those DLLs to be used freely in exploits! The end result? The attack surface is greatly expanded, making it possible to do more attacks on binaries previously constrained by limited gadgets. What may have been impossible before due to insufficient ROP gadgets, now is quite possible! While this talk focuses primarily on ASLR bypass for x64, we will also briefly touch upon similar attacks for x86. As part of this talk, for the first time ever, I am also releasing and open-sourcing a new mini-tool that will generate complete, x64 ROP chains for each of these bypasses! We will see this ASLR bypass attack in action with demo. We conclude with recommendations to help remediate the problem. This talk is an in-depth technical deep dive into Windows internals and the design of this technique, but it will also be presented in an accessible way to beginners.

Description:
In this session, Tobias Diehl will demonstrate a critical vulnerability in Microsoftâs CoPilot AI, exposing how data voids can be hijacked to manipulate AI-generated responses. By exploiting CoPilotâs reliance on limited data sources, Tobias will show how attackers can inject persistent malicious content, associating it with legitimate Microsoft topics, and how AI fails to validate key terms. The presentation will cover the mechanics of key term association attacks, data void exploitation, and their real-world implications, including the risk of CoPilot delivering dangerous installation instructions for command-and-control (C2) beacons for initial access. Using a proof-of-concept from Microsoftâs Zero Day Quest event, attendees will see how the hijacking process works in practice, how threat actors can target enterprise users, and how AI systems can be tricked into guiding users toward compromised actions.

Description:
Extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) has revolutionized Linux kernel programmability, but its complex verification and JIT compilation mechanisms present a significant attack surface. This talk provides a technical deep-dive into discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities in the eBPF subsystem, with three key contributions: state-aware fuzzing methodologies specifically designed for eBPF, focusing on verifier state tracking bugs, JIT compiler flaws, and helper function validation bypasses. These techniques go beyond traditional fuzzing by incorporating knowledge of the verifier's internal state machine.

Systematic approach to weaponizing verifier bypasses into practical kernel exploits, including converting bounds calculation errors into arbitrary read/write primitives, bypassing KASLR via targeted information leaks, and achieving privilege escalation through carefully constructed memory corruption.

Security architecture of eBPF and provide concrete recommendations for hardening the subsystem against these attacks, including improvements to the verifier's state tracking, JIT compiler security, and runtime validation.

ICS Malware is rare. Yet, ICS Malware like FrostyGoop and TRISIS, and related discoveries like COSMICENERGY, were all found on VirusTotal, so analysts still hunt for novel ICS Malware in public malware repositories. In the process, they discover all kinds of tools: research, CTFs, obfuscated nonsense code with no effects, and sometimes, malware targeting ICS/OT sites.  But how do they find and filter out the benign from malicious? Or the ICS and ICS-related malware from regular IT malware? 

In this talk, we will use recently discovered samples to walk through the process of hunting and analyzing potential ICS threats. Weâll show the simple queries we use to cast a net, our typical analysis process, and relevant follow-on actions like victim notification. Lastly, weâll discuss how we decide whether a sample is ICS malware using Dragosâs ICS malware definition.

Nation-state hackers pose a formidable threat to critical infrastructure, compromising national security, intellectual property, and public safety. This presentation will delve into the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed by nation-state actors, providing a core understanding essential for developing effective defense strategies.
Through an in-depth analysis of three real-world case studies, we will expose the implications of nation-state attacks on laboratory, critical infrastructure, and industrial systems. We will examine how these attacks exploit human vulnerabilities, such as social engineering and insider threats, as well as system weaknesses, including misconfiguration and software vulnerabilities.
Drawing from recent breaches in research laboratories and industrial manufacturing facilities, we will identify the root causes of these incidents, including human error, malicious insider actions, and inadequate security controls. This presentation aims to provide attendees with a comprehensive understanding of nation-state attack patterns, enabling them to strengthen their organizationâs defenses against these sophisticated threats.

Description:
Kubernetes is the de facto operating system of the cloud, and more and more organizations are running their workloads on Kubernetes. While Kubernetes offers many benefits, it also introduces new security risks, such as cluster misconfiguration, leaked credentials, cryptojacking, container escapes, and vulnerable clusters.

In this hands-on session, attendees will dive into the world of Kubernetes security by exploring powerful open source tools and practical techniques used to audit and exploit K8S clusters. You'll learn how to quickly identify misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in containerized applications running on Kubernetes, leverage those weaknesses to steal service account tokens, move laterally across the environment, and potentially take full control of the cluster. Whether you're a red teamer, bug bounty hunter, or just getting started in cloud security, this session will equip you with the skills to pwn your first Kubernetes cluster.

SpeakerBio:  Megan Allen
Hi, Iâm Megan Allen.

My work focuses on a holistic approach to health; moving the bodyâs natural energy into alignment with Earth and the seven chakras. I practice integrative wellness - honoring a person's emotional, mental, physical and spiritual well-being. I provide intuitive healing sessions and work with clients to relax the mind, increase body awareness and balance energy flow.

I also facilitate community wellness workshops, ceremonies and transformational group programs inviting participants to disconnect from their busy lives, turn inward and tap into the present to restore and maintain the bodyâs energetic balance and cultivate self-love, empowerment and sovereignty.

I inspire people to activate their highest potential in alignment with their wise hearts and to promote healing from within. I tailor my sessions to reflect this; using techniques from my healing disciplines as well as my love for Traditional Chinese Medicine, holistic aromatherapy, crystals and essential oils, tarot, animal medicine cards and a deep reverence for nature.

Nature is one of my greatest teachers. It constantly teaches me about grounding, stability, resilience, boundaries, growth, and stillness.

Description:
Offensive security is meant to improve defenses, but what happens when hostile nation-states start learning from us too? This talk explores how Russian intelligence services and advanced persistent threat (APT) groups have adopted and adapted techniques developed by Red Teamers, sometimes within weeks of public disclosure. These campaigns involve taking newly disclosed exploits, tools, and tricks to exploit modern enterprise systems, such as Microsoft 365 services, Windows features, software development systems, authentication systems, and cloud infrastructure.
Throughout the talk, detection engineering and threat hunting tips shall be provided to offer attendees a technique for detecting and preventing these types of attacks.

For Red Teamers, this talks is a wake-up call: the same tools and tradecraft used to test enterprise security are increasingly turning up in real-world espionage campaigns, sometimes targeting the very governments and public services we rely on.

Description:
As we know, spacecraft will become prime targets in the modern cyber threat landscape, as they perform critical functions like communication, navigation, and Earth observation. While the launch of the SPARTA framework in October 2022 gave the community insight into potential threats, it didnât address how to detect them in practical scenarios. In 2025, our research took a different approach as we didnât just theorize about threats, we actively exploited space systems using SPARTA techniques to figure out what Indicators of Behavior (IoBs) would look like in a real-world attack scenario.

By leveraging offensive cyber techniques from SPARTA, we identified the specific patterns and behaviors that adversaries might exhibit when targeting spacecraft. These insights allowed us to systematically develop IoBs tailored to the operational constraints and unique environments of space systems. As a result, we demonstrated how Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) for spacecraft can be designed with realistic, data-driven threat profiles.

This presentation will walk through our methodology, from exploiting space systems to crafting practical IoBs, and how these insights can directly translate to building robust IDS solutions. Weâll show how a threat-informed, hands-on approach to cybersecurity can transform theoretical knowledge into practical defenses for space infrastructure.

Bloatware. We all hate it, and most of us are good at avoiding it. But some vendor tools â especially those managing critical drivers âÂ are still necessary, often because the drivers available through Windows Update just arenât good enough for performance-critical computing.

What started as a routine driver update took a sharp turn when I confirmed a reboot modalâ¦ from my browser. Wait, my browser shouldnât be able to do that!? To my disappointment (and maybe some surprise), it turned out to be arbitrary code execution â right from the browser. This kicked off a week-long deep dive, uncovering seven trivial CVEs in seven days across several vendors, all exploiting a common pattern: privileged services managing software on Windows with little regard for security.

In this talk, Iâll walk through the journey of discovery and exploitation of several vulnerabilities that lead to LPE/RCE.

Description:
Bug bounty programs often resemble battlegrounds, where security researchers (""hackers"") and vulnerability triagers collide over validity, severity, and bounty rewards. Although this friction can strain relationships, it also represents a powerful opportunity for collaboration and community-building. In this session, experienced bug bounty hacker Richard Hyunho Im (@richeeta) and seasoned triage expert Denis SmajloviÄ (@deni) team up to dissect these challenging interactions, share real-world stories from high-stakes bounty scenarios, and propose practical solutions for improved hacker-triager relationships.

Drawing directly from their experiences on both the researcher and company sides, Richard and Denis cover common scenarios including severity debates (e.g., Gmail aliasing vulnerabilities), unclear bug submissions, controversial gray-area issues (such as Apple's BAC vulnerability rejection), and respectful escalation of bounty disputes (e.g., CVE-2025-24198). Attendees will gain insights into how effective communication, clear business impact framing, and mutual respect can bridge the divide between researchers and triagers.

Beyond monetary rewards, this presentation emphasizes how researchers can strategically leverage bug bounty work to enhance personal branding, build professional networks, and advance career opportunities. With empathy, humor, and candor, Richard and Denis demonstrate that the ""bounty battleground"" doesn't need to be hostile; it can instead become a place for growth, trust, and professional success.

Key takeaways include actionable strategies for clearer reporting, effectively communicating severity, navigating gray-area cases, and respectfully challenging triage decisions. Ultimately, this talk equips attendees with tools and mindsets to positively shape the bug bounty ecosystem and foster genuine collaboration within the community.

Abstract:

This hands-on workshop dives into real-world AWS misconfigurations that attackers actively exploit to gain privilege escalation and access sensitive data. Youâll step into the shoes of an adversary and learn how common oversights like loose IAM roles, misconfigured Cognito identity pools, or exposed metadata endpoints can be chained into full-blown breaches.

Key Takeaways:


Escalate IAM permissions to gain admin-level access
Exploit SSRF in EC2 to steal credentials
Abuse misconfigured Cognito identity pools for unauthorized access
Understand how small missteps can trigger large-scale compromise
Use tools like Cloud Nuke to safely clean and reset your infrastructure


Built for all skill levels, this lab gives security engineers, DevOps teams, and developers a safe space to break things, fix them, and come out with a sharper eye for spotting these risks before attackers do.

Description:
Whether you access the phone network over your cell phone, an SIP trunk, or via an old-school POTS line, the PSTN is an essential part of your day-to-day life and is a longstanding interest of the hacker community. Despite this interest, the regulatory and technical structures underlying this network are poorly understood, deliberately opaque, and dominated by large corporations. 

This talk will demystify the network, starting with a brief overview of the history of the PSTN, followed by a deep dive into the inner functioning of the network. After this, the session will detail the regulatory structures that govern the network, and the technologies it employs. Next, the talk will continue with a practical guide detailing how anyone can form a full local exchange carrier to provide service to their community, covering the entire formation process through first-hand experience: regulatory approval, building interconnect with the PSTN, voice network design, and most importantly, user security and privacy. 

With this knowledge in hand, the talk will briefly cover a range of exploits in the network, detailing how STIR/SHAKEN can be trivially bypassed, numbers can be hijacked, and how telecom fraud is monetized. The talk will conclude with a discussion of the future of the PSTN, and potential future issues.

Description:
Over the past three years, passkeys have gained widespread adoption among major vendors like Apple, Google, and Microsoft, aiming to replace passwords with a more secure authentication method. However, passkeys haven't yet faced the extensive scrutiny that passwords have endured over decades. As they become central to enterprise identity, it's crucial to examine their resilience.

This presentation demonstrates how attackers can proxy WebAuthn API calls to forge passkey registration and authentication responses. We'll showcase this using a browser extension as an example, but the same technique applies to any website vulnerable to client-side script injection, such as XSS or misconfigured widgets. The extension serves merely as a controlled means to proxy credential flows and manipulate the WebAuthn process.

We'll delve into the underlying theory, present the exploit code, and provide a live demonstration of an attack that succeeds on sites relying on passkeys without enforcing attestation or metadata checksâa common scenario among vendors. If youâre relying on passkeys, this is the side of the flow you donât usually get to see.

Description:
Wi-Fi Easy Connect is a protocol introduced by the Wi-Fi Alliance as the core replacement for Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS). It is designed to simplify device provisioning using user-friendly methods such as QR code scanning or short-range wireless technologies like NFC and Bluetooth. In this paper, we present a comprehensive security and privacy assessment of Wi-Fi Easy Connect (version 3.0).

Our analysis uncovered several security issues, including aspects of the protocolâs design that may unintentionally expand the attack surface compared to WPS. Notably, we found that design choices intended to enhance usability can compromise security. All identified issues were disclosed to the Wi-Fi Alliance, and we incorporated their feedback regarding mitigations and risk acceptance into our evaluation.

This work underscores the critical balance between usability and security in protocol design and the dangers of prioritizing ease-of-use at the expense of robust security guarantees.

Description:
Four years ago, Chris found a vulnerability with a murder for hire site on the dark net. He could exploit that vulnerability to intercept the murder orders that were being placed: names, addresses, pattern of life information, photos, and, in some cases, bitcoin payments. He reached out to Carl for help, and a small team was built in secret to intercept and triage these orders. However, after their warnings to the police fell on deaf ears, they ultimately decided to warn the targets on the kill list directly. After an initial series of successes, the investigation expanded rapidly and they formed a global cooperation with the FBI and police forces around the world, resulting over 175 murder orders being disclosed, 34 arrests 28 convictions and over 180 years of prison time being sentenced. This talk will be about those years: about the dangers and threats the team had to navigate, the times of isolation when the police wouldnât take them seriously, about raids in Romania to uncover the cyber-criminal gang running the site and the psychological impact of racing against time to try to stop people getting murdered.

Description:
Satellites are constantly orbiting the planet and beaming information back to us. Some of the most interesting information is weather images. As it turns out, it is very easy and cheap to pick up those signals and get a real-time view of your current location. In this talk I will go over what is out there, what you need to get, and the open source software stack to generate amazing images.

Some of the earliest weather satellites were launched in the 50's. Since that time, technology has come a long ways from simple images of clouds, with new payloads that can see through the clouds and give information like ocean wave heights, ground temperatures, wind speed and direction, and other interesting information.

The even better part of this is that all this information is being sent in the clear, continuously, meaning if you can receive it and decode it, you can view and use the data. Be your own weather forecaster! Hardware needed to accomplish this is as simple as a dipole antenna on a tripod and a $30 SDR dongle.

On the software side, there are many different programs you can use to collect the signal. Some, like SatDump, even do everything all in one place: tune, decode, and assemble the output all in a single click. It's even possible to setup a schedule and fully automate collecting imagery.

Moving beyond the simple APT data, you can get even higher resolution data if you build a simple dish antenna. While it is entirely possible to just hand-hold the antenna with a cell phone strapped to the back to show you where to point, it's just as easy to buy a cheap used dish rotator and have the same software automatically track it for you.

Once you get into decoding weather data, it's just a simple hop, skip and a jump to learning how to send signals to amateur radio satellites or even the ISS. And all you need is a Technician license!

Description:
Operational Technology (OT) describes devices and protocols used to control
real-world operations: factories, assembly lines, medical equipment, and so on.

For decades, this technology was isolated (more or less) from the wider world,
using custom protocols and communications media. However, over the past 15 - 20
years, these devices have started using commodity protocols and media more and
more. This means that these devices are now using the standard TCP/IP protocol
suite, a concept referred to as "OT/IT convergence."

This convergence has obvious benefits, making these devices cheaper and more
manageable. However, it also makes them more accessible to attackers, and their
security posture has often not kept up.

As part of this convergence process, many devices are connected via protocol
gateways. These gateways speak TCP/IP, and then translate communications to
proprietary OT protocols (or simply provide a NAT-style private network within
an OT device rack).

This talk discusses techniques for detecting devices on the "other side" of
these gateways. It begins with a brief introduction to the history of OT,
moving on to the OT/IT convergence phenomenon. It then discusses the issue of
protocol translation and provides two practical examples of discovering assets
across gateways: CIP (Common Industrial Protocol) message forwarding and DNP3
(Distributed Network Protocol, version 3) address discovery.

These techniques are provided as examples to illustrate the issue of OT device
discovery, and to encourage the audience to perform further research in how
these sorts of devices may be discovered on networks and, ultimately, protected.

In the space of months, we have seen AI move from a chat bot which writes funny limericks to an integral part of a developers workflow. AI coding assistants are now building entire apps and features as well as performing multi-repo refactoring, all whilst using MCP to interact with many other services.

In this round-table aimed at practitioners and developers, let's discuss how you have seen this in your own environments and how you have been able to both overcome the security challenges but also take advantage of capabilities which were not previously available.

SpeakerBio:  Josh Grossman, Bounce Security at OWASP
Josh Grossman has worked as a consultant in IT and Application Security and Risk for 15 years now, as well as a Software Developer. This has given him an in-depth understanding of how to manage the balance between business needs, developer needs and security needs which goes into a successful software security programme.

Josh is currently CTO for Bounce Security where he helps clients improve and get better value from their application security processes and provides specialist application security advice. His consultancy work has led him to work, speak and deliver training both locally and worldwide including privately for ISACA and Manicode and publicly for OWASP's Global AppSec conferences, NDC Security and Black Hat.

In his spare time, he co-leads the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard project and is on the OWASP Israel chapter board and the OWASP Events Committee. In 2025, OWASP recognised his contributions with a Distinguished Lifetime Membership award.

SpeakerBio:  Megan Allen
Hi, Iâm Megan Allen.

My work focuses on a holistic approach to health; moving the bodyâs natural energy into alignment with Earth and the seven chakras. I practice integrative wellness - honoring a person's emotional, mental, physical and spiritual well-being. I provide intuitive healing sessions and work with clients to relax the mind, increase body awareness and balance energy flow.

I also facilitate community wellness workshops, ceremonies and transformational group programs inviting participants to disconnect from their busy lives, turn inward and tap into the present to restore and maintain the bodyâs energetic balance and cultivate self-love, empowerment and sovereignty.

I inspire people to activate their highest potential in alignment with their wise hearts and to promote healing from within. I tailor my sessions to reflect this; using techniques from my healing disciplines as well as my love for Traditional Chinese Medicine, holistic aromatherapy, crystals and essential oils, tarot, animal medicine cards and a deep reverence for nature.

Nature is one of my greatest teachers. It constantly teaches me about grounding, stability, resilience, boundaries, growth, and stillness.

Description:
Purple Teaming has become a critical component of modern cybersecurity programs, but its definition and application vary widely across organizations. This presentation introduces a refined, regimented, and repeatable methodology for running Purple Team engagements, developed and battle-tested for over a decade.
As the term 'Purple Team' means different things to different peopleâ a methodology, a team of people, a program, an assessment, or even a state of mindâand as Purple Team engagements themselves come in all shapes and sizes, the speaker will begin by aligning recommended definitions and applications of common Purple Team terminology.
The presentation will explain how to apply an Assumed Compromise approach to Purple Teams. Any organization can be vulnerable at any point in time. This style of Purple Team testing follows the adversary through the entire life cycle of an attack, from Initial Access to Impact, assuming vulnerabilities exist to instead focus on the visibility of security tools. This is a powerful method of identifying ways to improve detection and prevention capabilities at each layer of an organizationâs defense in depth. The speaker will include real world examples and specific instructions.
The presentation will conclude with broader applications of this style of Purple Team. This will include how to collect and analyze the engagement results and apply these results to drive improvement to an organizationâs resilience to common threats.
This talk is ideal for security professionals, both Red and Blue Team, who are looking to elevate the way they perform Purple Team engagements.

Tags: Blacks In Cyber Village | Creator Talk/Panel
When: Sunday, Aug 10, 12:00 - 12:59 PDT
Where: LVCC West-Level 3-W322-W324 (Blacks In Cyber Village) - Map

Description:
In 2020, Jazmine Sullivan instructed us to unapologetically move on from the things that do not serve us. While toxic professional relationships can fall into that category, the underlying unjust baggage and biased perspectives of cybersecurity professionals are equally damaging as they can lead to poor and untimely decision-making. Consequences include investing in unnecessary or inadequate security controls, limiting talent acquisition sources, and not soundly understanding your attack surface. 

This presentation will review the logical fallacies and cognitive biases that manifest in cyber threat intelligence (CTI) and the adverse outcomes they introduce. It will then explore structured analytic techniques that analysts and leaders can apply to move beyond biases and objectively assess threats. Finally, the presentation will draw parallels between subjectivity and its unfavorable effects on holistic threat assessments and the oppressive attacks on diversity, equity, and inclusion programs throughout 2025, which are highly likely to introduce disparity in cybersecurity and the broader information technology field. After attending this talk, the audience will understand how bias can negatively affect CTI analysis and reporting and misguide cybersecurity judgments and strategy, impacting attendees' ability to identify, articulate, and correct concerns regarding subjective practices. Attendees will also learn how biases in recruiting and decision-making can adversely affect the cybersecurity of their respective organizations.

SpeakerBio:  Brett Alexander Tolbert
Brett Tolbert is a Principal Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Analyst based in the Baltimore metropolitan area. He has over ten years of experience in cybersecurity, beginning his career in the U.S. intelligence community before taking CTI roles at Morgan Stanley and NBCUniversal, which focused on tracking financially motivated threat actors and threat intelligence engineering. Brett teaches undergraduate cybersecurity courses at Bowie State University and has previously spoken at SANSâ CTI Summit and MITRE ATT&CKcon.

Description:
AWS Systems Manager (SSM) is a powerful service for managing and automating your AWS and hybrid infrastructure. However, its very flexibility can be weaponized by attackers seeking to gain unauthorized access, execute malicious code, establish persistence, and disrupt operations. This talk demonstrates the practical malicious use of various SSM features, revealing how attackers can abuse benign functionalities.   

We will dissect distinct attack vectors targeting SSM capabilities. Learn how Run Command can be leveraged for remote code execution at scale, turning your management tool into an attacker's playground. We'll explore the alarming potential of the SSM Agent being exploited as a persistent Remote Access Trojan (RAT), enabling stealthy cross-account control. Discover the risks lurking within publicly shared SSM Documents, exposing sensitive information to unintended eyes.

The session will further illuminate how Parameter Store, designed for secure configuration management, can be poisoned to compromise application logic and secrets. Understand how State Manager, intended for maintaining consistent configurations, can be twisted to establish persistent malicious states. We will also dissect the abuse of Session Manager for unauthorized interactive shell access, bypassing traditional network security controls and boundaries. The often-overlooked Patch Manager will be examined for its potential to disrupt patching cycles or, in specific scenarios, introduce malicious changes. Finally, we will explore how Distributor, a tool for software deployment, can be exploited to introduce and maintain a foothold of malicious packages across your fleet.

Crucially, this talk goes beyond simply identifying vulnerabilities. We will provide concrete and actionable hardening techniques and mitigation strategies for each abuse vector. Learn how to implement the principle of least privilege across SSM IAM permissions, establish robust monitoring and alerting mechanisms, and implement secure configuration practices for the Parameter Store and State Manager.

Attendees will understand the often-underestimated security risks associated with AWS SSM and acquire practical knowledge to fortify their AWS environments against these potential exploits. This session is essential for security professionals, cloud architects, DevOps engineers, and anyone responsible for the security and operational integrity of AWS infrastructures.

Outline with techniques we are going to present and discuss :
1. Abusing Run Command for Remote Code Execution:
2. Exploiting SSM Agent as a Remote Access Trojan (RAT)
3. Abusing Publicly Shared SSM Documents
4. Leveraging Parameter Store for Configuration Poisoning
5. Abusing State Manager for Persistent Configuration Drift
6. Abusing Session Manager for Unauthorized Interactive Access
7. Exploiting Patch Manager for Inconsistent or Malicious Patching
8. Weaponizing Software Distribution: Abusing AWS SSM Distributor

Description:
SESNSploit is a dedicated red team exploitation tool targeting AWS Simple Email Service (SES) and Simple Notification Service (SNS) misconfigurations. While existing frameworks like Pacu offer minimal or no coverage for these services, SESNSploit fills this gap by providing comprehensive attack scenarios. This includes enumerating regions, listing topics and identities, sending unauthorized emails or messages, and simulating misconfiguration exploitation. The tool is designed for red teamers, security researchers, and cloud security professionals to assess and identify potential security weaknesses in AWS SES and SNS setups.

We have added few of the following key features: 


Enumeration of active SES and SNS regions.
Identification of SES identities and SNS topics.
Unauthorized message and email sending simulations.
Menu-driven interface for easy navigation.
Supports state-saving for efficient testing and resumption.


SESNSploit offers functionalities that major AWS exploitation frameworks like Pacu currently lack. It specifically focuses on SES and SNS, which are often overlooked in security assessments but can be critical entry points if misconfigured.

Description:
The implementation of Active Directory environments is, by essence, not unlike a command-and-control infrastructure allowing to centrally coordinate and control network assets. As an attacker, why not make it your own ?

As far as the C2 capabilities of Active Directory go, Group Policy Objects (GPOs) are a key functionality that can be leveraged by attackers for a surprisingly wide range of offensive actions. From enumeration, to persistence, to impactful privilege escalation in mature segmented environments, abusing GPOs amounts to abusing the C2 capabilities of Active Directory itself â a powerful attack primitive.

And yet, GPOs received comparatively little attention by the pentesting and research community. GPOs exploitation knowledge and tooling is scarce, whether because implementation may seem kind of obscure, or since exploitation can be seen as risky. Concerns that well-equipped attackers may not have to worry about.

This presentation aims at demonstrating the full extent of possibilities offered by Group Policy Objects. It will dive deep into GPOs implementation, enumeration potential and advanced exploitation techniques introduced or implemented by the speakers these last few years. It will also be accompanied by the release of two enumeration and exploitation tools developed by the speakers.

Description:
DCs are organizationsâ core. A successful DoS attack against them can break authentication and paralyze operations.

Following our LdapNightmare release, the first public DoS exploit for CVE-2024-49113, we found two new DoS-style attack surfaces on DCs: new critical DoS vulnerabilities, and creating a botnet harnessing public DCs for DDoS. Our goal: create the Win-DoS epidemic - infect DCs with Win-DoS and make them infect others, forming Win-DDoS.

Building on LDAPNightmare, we explored client-side targeting, often exposing weaker code. By turning DCs into LDAP clients via NetLogon RPC, using LDAP referrals, we redirected them to chosen domains/ports, matching our goals.

Moreover, we knew DDoS was powerful, but aimed to replicate its effect from a single machine. We focused on RPC servers - abundant in Windows with wide attack surfaces, especially those not requiring authentication. By abusing security gaps in RPC bindings, we hit the same RPC server relentlessly from one system, far surpassing standard concurrency limits! and WOW, found vulns crashing any Windows: servers and endpoints alike!

We present âWin-DoS Epidemicâ - DoS tools exploiting four new Win-DoS and one Win-DDoS zero-click vulns! Crash any Windows endpoint/server, including DCs, or launch a botnet using public DCs for DDoS. The epidemic has begun

Description:
With billions of users worldwide, mobile messaging apps like WhatsApp and Signal have become critical for personal and professional communication. While these platforms promise security and privacy, our research uncovers two significant vulnerabilities that expose users to stealthy tracking and security degradation.

First, we reveal how delivery receipts --commonly used to confirm message delivery-- can be exploited to track a user's online status, screen activity, and device usage without their knowledge. This technique enables passive surveillance, draining a target's battery and data allowance while remaining entirely invisible to them.

Second, we demonstrate a novel attack on WhatsApp's implementation of the Signal Protocol, specifically targeting its Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) mechanism. By depleting a victim's stash of ephemeral encryption keys, an attacker can weaken message security, disrupt communication, and exploit flaws in the prekey refilling process.

Both attacks require nothing more than the victim's phone number and leverage fundamental design choices in these widely used platforms. 

This talk will provide an in-depth analysis of these vulnerabilities, their implications, and potential mitigations -- challenging the security assumptions of modern encrypted messaging.

Description:
The rapid proliferation of consumer IoT devices has introduced new attack vectors beyond traditional exploitation. One overlooked risk lies in firmware persistence in returned devicesâan issue that could enable mass surveillance, botnet propagation, or backdoor persistence at scale. This research investigates whether major retailers properly reset IoT firmware before reselling returned products, exposing critical gaps in supply chain security.

In this experiment, commercial IoT devices are purchased, modified with custom firmware embedding a simple callback, and then returned to the store. The devices are later repurchased and analyzed to determine if retailers performed proper firmware resets or if malicious code remained intact.
Findings from this research reveal inconsistencies in retailer sanitization policies, with some major retailers failing to properly wipe and reflash firmware before resale. This talk will demonstrate examples of persistent firmware modifications, discuss the potential for IoT-based supply chain attacks, and propose real-world mitigation strategies for manufacturers, retailers, and consumers.

Attendees will leave with a deeper understanding of how IoT firmware sanitization failures create a new class of attack vectorsâand how threat actors could exploit this to build persistent IoT botnets, data-exfiltration implants, or unauthorized surveillance tools.

Testing Firmware Persistence in Commercial IoT", Matei reveals how threat actors can implant persistent backdoors in smart devices, then return them for resale through legitimate retailers. Because factory reset processes often fail to wipe firmware-level compromises, attackers can exploit the trust users place in brand-name resellersâturning returned devices into credible, persistent attack vectors.

Description:
We demonstrate a vulnerability in a commonly-used autopilot computer that allows unsigned firmware to be pushed through trusted update channels such as SD cards and NMEA 2000 networked chart plotters without authentication or cryptographic validation. We show how a malicious â.swupâ file can be crafted and accepted by the system to gain persistent code execution, enabling arbitrary CAN bus injection on marine control networks. The attack chain, reminiscent of removable media-style delivery in air-gapped systems, demonstrates how firmware-level control in marine environments can be leveraged to disrupt navigation subsystems. We will walk through firmware extraction, reverse engineering of firmware and CAN subroutines, firmware repackaging, and live effects on NMEA 2000 networks. No physical access to the autopilot is needed, the attack leverages trusted firmware delivery via the chart plotter over NMEA 2000.

Description:
Letâs face it â traditional HTTP C2 is burning out. Between aging domains, TLS cert management, sandbox fingerprinting, and blue teams getting smarter at categorizing traffic and infrastructure, your âcustom C2â feels less covert and more like a liability. Red teams and threat actors alike are shifting toward living off legitimate services â AWS, GitHub, Box, Notion, whatever blends in â but building solutions that are custom to a single C2 framework? Letâs stop doing that. Letâs share the fun!

C4 (Cross-Compatible Command & Control) is here to change that. Itâs a modular toolkit of WASM-powered plugins that makes external C2 easy to implement, regardless of your implant's language or target OS. Whether youâre writing in C, Rust, Go, Python, C#, or something else entirely, C4 plugins can be loaded directly into your implant and run on Windows, macOS, or Linux.

But the real game-changer? C4 provides a single, centralized collection of numerous fully-documented, operationally-ready external C2 modules â not just proof-of-concepts, but production-level integrations with trusted sites that fly under the radar. No more hunting through GitHub repos, hand-rolling fragile API calls, or hacking together glue code for every new environment.

Stop reinventing external C2 and start planting some C4 in your implants!

Description:
Microsoft Configuration Manager, better known as SCCM, has become my go-to target for red team operations. While multiple attack paths were uncovered recently, companies still struggle to close all security gaps. This is largely due to the solution's complexity and historical technical debt, which make it challenging to effectively address and mitigate all security vulnerabilities. Moreover, as it primarily manages computers, taking over an SCCM deployment often leads to the full compromise of the Active Directory, with less hassle than traditional attack paths.

In this talk, I'll be sharing insights gained from my research on the solution that led to the discovery of multiple 0 Day vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2024-43468, an unauthenticated SQL injection. After introducing key concepts, I'll delve into various techniques for performing reconnaissance, tips for understanding the hierarchy and tricks for bypassing certain security boundaries. The session will also cover the discovered vulnerabilities that can lead to the compromise of the deployment.

After showcasing post-exploitation techniques from database access, I'll introduce a battle-tested open-source tool that implements them. And for those interested in persistence, a technique for installing a backdoor as a legitimate servicing endpoint will be shared.

Description:
Dealers are a vital part of the automotive industry â intentionally separate entities from the manufacturers, but highly interconnected. Most dealers use platforms built by the manufacturers that can be used to order cars, view/store customer information, and manage their day-to-day operations. Earlier this year, new vulnerabilities were discovered in a top automakerâs dealer platform that enabled the creation of a national admin account. This level of access, a privilege reserved for a select few corporate users, opened the door to a wide range of fun exploits.

Want to start a car? Forget VINs â all you needed was someoneâs name. Access to the enrollment systems made it possible to reassign ownership of cars and access remote control functionality.

Want to find out who owns that sleek ride next to you? A quick glance at the VIN on the windshield was all you needed to pull down the ownerâs personal information using the customer lookup tool.

Want to impersonate the owner of a dealership to gain full access to everything? A user impersonation function was uncovered that made this possible - negating all the two-factor authentication systems.

All of this and much more was made possible through API flaws in a centralized dealer system. A system used by more than 1,000 dealers in the USA that you didnât even know existed. A system that you would never have thought would be the unexpected connection to your car. We break down the full exploit from recon to initial access, from viewing PII to the satisfying roar of an engine coming to life.

Tags: DEF CON Official Talk | Demo ð»
When: Sunday, Aug 10, 14:00 - 14:20 PDT
Where: LVCC West-Level 1-Exhibit Hall 3-Track 3 - Map

Description:
Everyone knows not to trust pickle files, but what about .onnx, .h5, or .npz? This talk explores how trusted file formats used in AI and large language model workflows can be weaponized to deliver reverse shells and stealth payloads. These attacks rely solely on the default behavior of widely used machine learning libraries and do not require exploits or unsafe configuration.

The presentation focuses on formats that are not typically seen as dangerous: ONNX, HDF5, Feather, YAML, JSON, and NPZ. These formats are commonly used across model sharing, training pipelines, and inference systems, and are automatically loaded by tools such as onnx, h5py, pyarrow, and numpy. A live demo will show a healthcare chatbot executing code silently when these formats are deserialized, with no user interaction and no alerts. This is a demonstration of how trusted data containers can become malware carriers in AI systems. Attendees will leave with a clear understanding of the risks introduced by modern ML workflows, and practical techniques for payload delivery, threat detection, and hardening against this type of tradecraft.

Tags: DEF CON Official Talk | Demo ð»
When: Sunday, Aug 10, 14:00 - 14:20 PDT

Description:
Anticounterfeiting is an obscure and private world. Companies tightly hold their secrets and rely heavily on security through obscurity. But banknotes and government IDs arenât the only targets of counterfeiting. Live events are increasingly targeted as ticket prices increase. The fast moving and dynamic nature of live events makes both counterfeiting and anticounterfeiting a more complex challenge. The limited time before the event ends is a key defense for event producers. 

But with a basic mix of social engineering, arts and crafts, and keen observation most of these credentials can be defeated using DIY techniques. Even advanced measures like UV ink or holograms can be defeated or avoided with techniques you might have learned in art class. But while copying a credential seems easy enough, there are numerous mistakes that would-be counterfeiters make. 

This talk will reveal 11 beginner mistakes to credential copying and how to avoid them. With physical examples of real historical credentials from NASA, NATO, the US Navy, the NFL, and more, this talk will leave you ready to fake a badge like a pro.
