Description:
Can prompt injections lead to complete infrastructure takeovers? Could AI applications be exploited to compromise backend services? Can data poisoning in AI copilots impact a company's stock? Can jailbreaks create false crisis alerts in security systems? This immersive, CTF-styled training in GenAI and LLM security dives into these pressing questions. Engage in realistic attack and defense scenarios focused on real-world threats, from prompt injection and remote code execution to backend compromise. Tackle hands-on challenges with actual AI applications to understand vulnerabilities and develop robust defenses. Youâll learn how to create a comprehensive security pipeline, mastering AI red and blue team strategies, building resilient defenses for LLMs, and handling incident response for AI-based threats. Additionally, implement a Responsible AI (RAI) program to  enforce ethical AI standards across enterprise services, fortifying your organizationâs AI security foundation.

By 2026, Gartner, Inc. predicts that over 80% of enterprises will engage with GenAI models, up from less than 5% in 2023. This rapid adoption presents a new challenge for security professionals. To bring you up to speed from intermediate to advanced level, this training provides essential GenAI and LLM security skills through an immersive CTF-styled framework. Delve into sophisticated techniques for mitigating LLM threats, engineering robust defense mechanisms, and operationalizing LLM agents, preparing them to address the complex security challenges posed by the rapid expansion of GenAI technologies.  You will be provided with access to a live playground with custom built AI applications replicating real-world attack scenarios covering use-cases defined under the OWASP LLM top 10 framework and mapped with stages defined in MITRE ATLAS. This dense training will navigate you through areas like the red and blue team strategies, create robust LLM defenses, incident response in LLM attacks, implement a Responsible AI(RAI) program and enforce ethical AI standards across enterprise services, with the focus on improving the entire GenAI supply chain.

This training will also cover the completely new segment of Responsible AI(RAI), ethics and trustworthiness in GenAI services. Unlike traditional cybersecurity verticals, these unique challenges such as bias detection, managing risky behaviors, and implementing mechanisms for tracking information are going to be the key challenges for enterprise security teams.

By the end of this training, you will be able to:


Exploit vulnerabilities in AI applications to achieve code and command execution, uncovering scenarios such as cross-site scripting, injection attacks, insecure agent designs, and remote code execution for infrastructure takeover.

Description:
Hackers have a unique perspective on the world and in particular on the technological artifacts within it. When most people look at a high tech system, they see what they were meant to see by the people who created it. Hackers see technology as it truly is, not as it was meant to be, and this way of looking at things enables hackers to discover possibilities that were never intended in the first place.

For centuries, military and intelligence strategists have sought to view the world from a similar perspective - a perspective that can see the hidden possibilities and weaknesses in things and take advantage of them to create unexpected results. 

This unique course draws lessons from both the hacker community and from military thinking in order to deepen your ability to understand adversaries and see things the way that adversaries see them. 

Honing this skill is particularly valuable for people who are building technological systems that might be subject to misuse and need to be able to anticipate that misuse. Whether you are an aspiring red teamer, a hardware engineer, software developer or product owner striving to understand how your product will be abused, or you work in fraud detection, risk analysis, election security, or any other domain where you face an adversary, youâll find this course a valuable addition to your skill set.

We willâ¦


Survey adversarial thinking in a wide range of domains
Review the history of hacking and phone phreaking and understand how they influenced the development of a way of thinking about technology
Explore lock picking and physical security
Iteratively decompose an organization or complex system to find its most critical dependencies and develop methods of attacking those dependencies successfully
Consider how one might creatively steal from your employer and what controls are necessary to prevent this from happening
Examine how and why you might be targeted by foreign intelligence 
Practice cheating on a test
Understand how the mental models we develop for how things work can prevent us from seeing how they actually work
See how levels of abstraction in computer technology can hide vulnerabilities
Learn how to read technical standards and see the things that they fail to say
Practice fooling your customers by offering products with unstated capabilities
Explore how state cyber operations are organized and could target your organization
Study the crowdsourcing of adversaries, as seen in Ukraine
Explore dangerous security assumptions
Investigate deception techniques
Practice detecting and role-playing insider threats
And much moreâ¦


After completing the course youâll leave with:


An improved offensive mindset and ability to identify weaknesses and other unintended characteristics of systems.
Heightened awareness of non-obvious threats and threat actors across the spectrum of the cyber, information, cognitive, and physical domains. 
Practical tools and techniques to better assess security risk and employ security controls.
A deeper understanding of threat actor TTPs and countermeasures in areas such as: state-level cyberspace operations, electronic warfare and surveillance, supply chain compromise, hardware implants, deception operations, human intelligence collection, physical security, influence operations, targeting methodologies, and novel threat intelligence analytic techniques, among numerous other topics.
Improved critical thinking techniques via an understanding of how the world, its threat actors, and the enterprise security environment behave in practice, not how defenders assume it to be.
An enhanced ability to fluidly shift from the mindset of a defender into that of an attacker, and back again.
Diverse sources of additional information to aid participantsâ continued self-development.


This interesting and fast-moving class will include hands-on exercises to apply and reinforce the skills learned. Youâll leave this course with a fresh perspective and a toolkit of techniques to better accomplish your mission. Come join us.

Description:
Dive deep into cutting edge techniques that bypass or neuter modern endpoint defenses. Learn how these solutions work to mitigate their utility and hide deep within code on the endpoint. The days of downloading that binary from the internet and pointing it at a remote machine are over. Todayâs defenses oftentimes call for multiple bypasses within a single piece of code. 

This course is designed to take you deep into defensive and offensive tooling â an apex attacker must know the own indicators of compromise (IOCs) theyâre creating and the artifacts theyâre leaving behind.

Imagine, you are a novice red teamer and you have been tasked with leading a 16-week full-scope red team engagement against a highly mature Fortune 50 company. No, Metapsloit and Mimikatz are not going to work. Do you take your ball and go home? Nope, it's time to build a lab and see what is going to bypass their tech stack.

Do you phish from the external? Maybe an illicit consent grant in Azure? What loader do I use? Is process injection even going to be necessary?  Stop being lost in the offensive cyber sauce; get informed and get to work. WKL's flagship course, Offensive Development, is meant to prepare red teamers and blue teamers for the present day cyberwar. These are not last year's TTPs, WKL will be teaching hyper-current tools and techniques that are being used in current red team operations. 

The Offensive Development course is not focused on theory, students will be given a Terraform script that spins up their own isolated AWS lab environment that has several fully patched Windows virtual machines that have various EDR products installed and a fully licensed version of the Cobalt Strike C2 framework.

The pace of finding new offensive cyber techniques that bypass modern detection moves slightly faster than the defense can handle. This course will help red teamers and blue teamers understand the current state of the red/blue war and where the community is heading next, the kernel.

Your lab environment is yours to keep continuing honing your skills. Although the EDR and Cobalt Strike licenses will expire, and the Earth may turn to dust, your AWS lab environment will live forever.  

Although the OD course comes with Cobalt Strike, students are free to install whichever C2 framework they're most comfortable with. Students will receive an additional Ubuntu workstation in their lab environment to install whatever additional tooling they feel is necessary.

Description:
In today's interconnected world, software development relies heavily on third-party components---up to 80% of your code could come from external sources. This reliance creates a complex web of dependencies, making your software supply chain a prime target for cybercriminals. Securing it is no longer optional; it's essential.

This hands-on course takes a comprehensive approach to attacking and securing the software supply chain. In the first section, you'll assume the role of a sophisticated attacker, infiltrating an enterprise through its supply chain partners. You'll learn how to compromise developer laptops, code repositories, CI/CD pipelines, internal registries, and even production environments. Once you've seen how vulnerabilities can be exploited, we'll pivot to defense.

In the second section, we'll build and secure a GitHub organization, configure repositories, and implement best practices to mitigate risks. You'll learn how to secure IaC (Infrastructure as Code) assets, validate third-party code, and remediate vulnerabilities to ensure end-to-end protection.

Through practical exercises, you'll apply these strategies to safeguard your developer environments, CI/CD pipelines, and production systems. By the end of the course, you'll have the knowledge and tools to turn your software supply chain into a security strength rather than a liability.

Description:
More than 95% of Fortune 500 companies use Active Directory! Enterprises are managed using Active Directory (AD) and it often forms the backbone of the complete enterprise network. Therefore, to secure an enterprise from an adversary, it is inevitable to secure its AD environment. To secure AD, you must understand different techniques and attacks used by adversaries against it. Often burdened with maintaining backward compatibility and interoperability with a variety of products, AD environments lack ability to tackle latest threats.

This training is aimed towards attacking modern AD with focus on OPSEC and Stealth. The training is based on real world penetration tests and Red Team engagements for highly secured environments.  Some of the techniques used in the course:


Introduction to OPSEC and Stealth used in the class.
Offensive .NET and PowerShell tradecraft
Extensive AD Enumeration
Active Directory trust mapping and abuse.
Privilege Escalation (User Hunting, Delegation issues, LAPS abuse, gMSA abuse, SPN Hijacking, Shadow Credentials and more)
Advanced Kerberos Attacks and Defense (Diamond, Golden, Silver ticket, Kerberoast and more)
Advanced cross forest trust abuse (Lateral movement across forest, PrivEsc and more)
Credentials Replay Attacks (Over-PTH, Token Replay, Certificate Replay etc.)
Attacking Entra ID integration (Hybrid Identity)
Abusing trusts for MS products (AD CS, SQL Server etc.)
Persistence (WMI, GPO, Domain and Host ACLs and more)
Monitoring Active Directory
Defenses (JEA, PAW, LAPS, Selective Authentication, Deception, App Allowlisting, MDE EDR, Microsoft Defender for Identity etc.)
Bypassing defenses (MDE, MDI and Elastic)


The course is a mixture of fun, demos, exercises, hands-on and lecture. You start from compromise of a user desktop and work your way up to multiple forest pwnage. The training focuses more on methodology and techniques than tools.

Description:
This hands-on two-day training offers a comprehensive guide to incident response in the Microsoft cloud, covering various topics essential for handling threats and attacks. The course starts with an overview of the concepts of the Microsoft cloud that are relevant for incident response. Participants will learn how to scope an incident in the Microsoft cloud and how to leverage it to set up an incident response capability. On the first day you will be immersed in the world of Azure attacks, we cover the different phases of an attack focusing on the evidence an attack leaves and how you can identify attacks based on the available evidence. On the second day we will shift our focus to Microsoft 365. The training covers the different types of evidence available in a Microsoft 365 environment. Participants will gain an understanding of how to acquire data from a Microsoft 365 environment using multiple methods and tools, and how to parse, enrich, and analyze the Microsoft 365 Unified Audit Log (UAL). The best part of the training is that everything you learn you'll apply with hands-on labs in a CTF like environment. Additionally we have created two full attack scenarios in both Azure & M365 and you're tasked in the CTF to solve as many pieces of the puzzle as you can.

Korstiaan Stam is the Founder and CEO of Invictus Incident Response & SANS Trainer - FOR509: Cloud Forensics and Incident Response. Korstiaan is a passionate incident responder, preferably in the cloud. He developed and contributed to many open-source tools related to cloud incident response. Korstiaan has gained a lot of knowledge and skills over the years which he is keen to share.  

Way before the cloud became a hot topic, Korstiaan was already researching it from a forensics perspective. âBecause I took this approach I have an advantage, because I simply spent more time in the cloud than others. More so, because I have my own IR consultancy company, I spent a lot of time in the cloud investigating malicious behavior, so I donât just know one cloud platform, but I have knowledge about all of them.â That equips him to help students with the challenge of every cloud working slightly or completely different. âIf you understand the main concepts, you can then see that thereâs also a similarity among all the clouds. That is why I start with the big picture in my classes and then zoom in on the details. Korstiaan also uses real-life examples from his work to discuss challenges heâs faced with students to relate with their day-to-day work. âTo me, teaching not only means sharing my knowledge on a topic, but also applying real-life implications of that knowledge. I always try to combine the theory with the everyday practice so students can see why itâs important to understand certain concepts and how the newly founded knowledge can be applied.â

Description:
Software Defined Radios (SDRs) are a powerful tool that has made the once-obfuscated domain of the electromagnetic spectrum open to anyone with a low-cost laptop and radio. From both an offensive and defensive perspective, an enormous attack surface, with many legacy devices and protocols, is open for exploitation. SDR 101 is a course designed for cyber security professionals of all skill levels who want to start working with RF signals and SDRs.

This class is a beginner's introduction to practical Software Defined Radio applications and development with an emphasis on hands-on learning. If you have ever been curious about the invisible world of radio waves and signals all around you, but didn't know where to begin, then this course is for you. Students can expect to learn about basic RF theory and SDR architecture before moving on to hands-on development with real radios. Over the two-day course, the instructor will guide students through progressively more complicated RF concepts and waveforms, culminating in a small capstone exercise. Students will be provided with a HackRF SDR for the duration of the class but will need to bring their own laptop to interface with the radio. VMs will be made available to students to download before class, along with an OS setup guide for those that prefer a bare-metal install. The VM/OS will have all the required drivers and frameworks to interface with the radio hardware, allowing us to jump right into hands-on exercises. My intent for this course is to lower the barrier of entry associated with RF hacking and give beginning students a practical understanding of RF and DSP applications with SDRs.

SpeakerBio:  Richard Shmel
Richard Shmel is an experienced research and development engineer focusing on radio communications and digital signals processing applications. He has over a decade of experience as an RF engineer and embedded software developer working on prototype radio systems and DSP frameworks. Disappointed by the lack of introductory SDR material he could give to new engineers, he decided to write his own training courses to help fill the gap. Richard has had the privilege of teaching SDR workshops and training at various local and national cyber security conferences - including DEF CON - for many years now. He is passionate about teaching RF/DSP and wireless technology, and will happily talk for hours on the subject if given the chance. Learn more at https://www.rnstechsolutions.com/.

Beyond firewalls and network hardening, government and enterprise alike must consider how security infrastructure safeguards digital, material, and human assets. Physical security is foundational to the ability to resist unauthorized access or malicious threat.

In this training developed by world-renowned access-control expert Babak Javadi, students will be immersed in the mysteries of PACS tokens, RFID credentials, readers, alarm contacts, tamper switches, door controllers, and back-haul protocols that underpin Physical Access Control Systems (PACS) across the globe. The course provides a holistic and detailed view of modern access control and outlines common design limitations that can be exploited. Penetration testers will gain a practical understanding of what PACS looks like in the field, and how to intercept, clone, downgrade, replay, and bypass one's way through the system. Defenders, designers, and directors will come with away with best practices and techniques that will resist attacks.

Participation will include hands-on practical experience with tools, exploits, and refined methods for compromising modern Physical Access Control Systems.

Description:
Crypto related bugs are super common. OWASP even ranks "Cryptographic Failure" as the second most common security vulnerability class in software. Yet, very often these vulnerabilities are overlooked by developers, code auditors, blue teamers and penetration testers alike. Because, let's face it: Nobody knows how cryptography works.

During the course you will:


understand how modern cryptography works.
find common crypto vulnerabilities in real software.
write crypto exploits for real software (and an IoT device).


Using case studies from our own pentesting and red teaming engagements, we'll introduce core concepts of applied cryptography and how they fail in practice.

This course turns you into a powerful weapon. You will know how applied cryptography works, how it's commonly misused in the field and how this leads to exploitable bugs. That means, by the end of the course you will be among the very selected group of people that can identify, avoid and exploit vulnerabilities in code using crypto.

No prior knowledge required!

Learning Objectives


Learn how modern cryptography operates. Learn what kind of guarantees are given by certain primitives, and which aren't.
Understand how crypto primitives are combined into protocols.
Learn how cryptography is often misused in practice and how this misuse can be exploited.
Write exploits for systems using cryptography in an inappropriate way.
Evaluate program code that uses cryptography for proper usage.
Identify cryptographic schemes and potential vulnerabilities in black-box tests.

Description:
Since our sold out class in 2024, we have refreshed the material to incorporate not only Agentic AI but Content Augmentation Generation (CAG)!

Have you ever wondered how the pros use AI to solve their complex cybersecurity problems? Come find out!

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as robust and powerful tools that have redefined how many approach problem solving. The last few years have seen industry AI interest surge while Cybersecurity experts struggle not only to threat model LLMs but to leverage them effectively. Our training presents a comprehensive educational framework aimed at equipping students with the necessary skills to not only build their own LLM toolkits but to leverage AI and LLMs to build elegant solution to solve complex problems unique to their own environments.

This class will teach students how to build their own AI frameworks to ingest data from either SaaS or on-prem data lakes. We will provide both the tools for data data consumption but as well as data warehousing. From there we will walk students through transforming this data and making it operationally effective and efficient for their AI. We will cover various types of data common to Cybersecurity environments, protentional issues with certain data types, and how to make the most of opensource to help transform the data. We will also touch on training and LoRA for model customization.

As Cybersecurity experts, we also need to understand the risk that comes with the use of AI. For this purpose, we will discuss foundational knowledge to conduct both red and blue team exercises regarding AI. We will discuss risk analysis of the disparate components used to make AI functional, a holistic and functional approach to defending the supply chain, understanding vulnerability analysis, and modern day adversary attacks and techniques that you will encounter. Understanding modern security policy frameworks is just as important and we will cover a few of the popular frameworks used to secure and apply policy to your AI environment. We will cap this section of class off with a practicum of both attacking and defending our AI deployed in class.

Using the tools created in class, we will use the SOCMAN DEF CON model to solve hand-picked operational problems we have seen teams struggle with all over the world. You will learn how to use LLMs with agentic AI, how to augment our queries with our own data in two different methods (RAG/CAG), generate high quality YARA/SIGMA rules using your own data, tune your model to hunt complex patterns, improve application observability by adding context to "weird" behavior, how to hunt for APTs using real world scenarios and logs (Stuxnet), filter out noise to increase signal in your environment (SNR), and much more! All of these labs will be performed by students and will leverage AI as middleware to add contextual data between disparate platforms to solve your complex cybersecurity problems. All use cases will be performed by students live and in-class.

By the end of this training you will be able to:


Build their own AI-powered cybersecurity framework, including custom tooling, ingestion pipelines, and LLM orchestration
Ingest and warehouse data from SaaS and on-prem sources, transforming it for AI readiness using open-source tools
Apply Agentic AI and Content Augmentation Generation (CAG) to real-world cybersecurity challenges
Select, train, and fine-tune models, including LoRA customization for environment-specific detection and automation
Generate high-quality YARA and SIGMA rules using real-world data and AI-assisted pattern matching
Augment detection logic using RAG/CAG, enhancing context-awareness and improving incident triage
Understand foundational knowledge to defend your AI deployments, including threat modeling, adversary simulation, and defending AI infrastructure
Analyze and enrich logs using AI, identify complex behavioral patterns, and detect APT activity using real-world examples like Stuxnet
Improve observability by adding AI-generated context to anomalous or hard-to-interpret behaviors
Increase signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by using AI to reduce false positives and highlight meaningful security events
Solve complex cybersecurity problems!
