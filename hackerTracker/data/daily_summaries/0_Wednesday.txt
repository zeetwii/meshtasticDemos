Description:
The DEF CON Shoot is a public event that happens just prior to the DEF CON hacker conference in Las Vegas, Nevada. It is an opportunity to see and shoot some of the guns belonging to your friends while taking pride in showing and firing your own steel, as well, in a relaxed and welcoming atmosphere. We choose a spot, then we rent tables, canopies, and bring all the necessary safety equipment and amenities. All you need to bring yourself and (optionally) your firearms. New shooters and veterans both attend regularly. You can attend with your firearms, of course, but folk without guns of their own in Vegas may have the opportunity to try gear from others in attendance. Admission costs are intentionally kept low, just so we can break even on expenses for the amenities provided.

Offsite - Pro Gun Vegas Address: 12801 US 95 South. Boulder City, NV 89005

From 17:00 to 07:59, Social Gatherings/Events is hosting '' to present 'Linecon', which is about 'Title: Linecon
Tags: Misc
When: Wednesday, Aug 6, 17:00 - 07:59 PDT
Where: LVCCW-Level 1-W101-W102 - Map

Description:
Linecon is your optional opportunity to stand (or sit) in line for human registration to open. Doors will open for linecon on Wednesday at approximately 17:00. When human registration opens on Thursday at approximately 08:00, they start working the linecon queue, and the line will start moving quickly. (Please understand that we will begin processing the line on Thursday morning as soon as the cashiers and materials are in place; we will strive for Thursday 08:00, but actual start may be slightly earlier or later.)

Online badge purchase (aka pre-registration) has no impact on linecon. You can join the line on Wednesday (if you wish) regardless of whether you purchased a badge online or intend to pay with cash. There is only one linecon for both types of badge sales. 

Please help us make this a great experience for everyone by following directions given by goons. After human registration opens, there may be one line for all of registration, or there may be two lines (one for online sales (pre-registration) and one for cash sales). This may also change over time, based on available staffing and necessary crowd control. We will strive to make it easily understandable in-person as to which line you should join. 

Please also review the "Human Registration Open" event, and familiarize yourself with the important notes therein.
