Description:
Defcon.run is a beloved tradition at DEF CON, bringing together hackers for a refreshing start to the day. Originally known as the DEF CON 4x5K, the event has evolved into a distributed, community-driven experience featuring fun runs and rucks across Las Vegas. Participants can choose from various routes, ranging from simple 5Ks to more ambitious distances.

For DEF CON 33, the gathering point is "The Spot" by the North Entrance of the Las Vegas Convention Center West Hall. Here, the real wild hares gather before the sun has a chance to burn up this city of sin. The runs kick off at 06:00 Thursday through Sunday! But be there early for hype talks and shenanigans. We also have a whole new Meshtastic setup and website features we're adding. There are other runs swag drops and social meetups planned throughout the day and night as well!

Whether you're a seasoned runner or looking for something different, defcon.run offers a unique way to connect with other hackers and kick off your day. For more details and to sign up, visit defcon.run.

Description:
All merch sales are USD CASH ONLY. No cards will be accepted.

The published hours for the merch area are only an approximation: supplies are limited, and when merch is sold out, the merch area will close for the year. (We intend to update this schedule to reflect their true operating status, but this is strictly best-effort.) 

Note that the closing hours here are when sales must have ended. For example, if sales must end by 18:00, and we estimate that it will take 2 hours to clear the queue, doors are likely to close around 16:00. Because of this dynamic nature, we can't predict the length of the line or when doors will be closed.

Description:
Our human registration process this year will be very similar to previous years. Please be patient. All of the times listed here are approximate. 

Basics

Who needs a badge?

A badge is required for each human age 8 and older.

Human?

You are a human if you do not know otherwise. People that are not humans include goons, official speaker, village/community/contest/creator staff, press, black badge holders, or similar. If you are not a human, you need to register separately. If you don't know how, see an NFO goon (NFO Node, formerly known as an infobooth, is where you can get help). The remainder of this message applies only to humans.

Lines? Linecon?

Linecon is your optional opportunity to stand (or sit) in line for human registration to open. Doors will open for linecon on Wednesday at approximately 17:00. When human registration opens on Thursday at approximately 08:00, they start working the linecon queue, and the line will start moving quickly. (Please understand that we will begin processing the line on Thursday morning as soon as the cashiers and materials are in place; we will strive for Thursday 08:00, but actual start may be slightly earlier or later.)

Online badge purchase (aka pre-registration) has no impact on linecon. You can join the line on Wednesday (if you wish) regardless of whether you purchased a badge online or intend to pay with cash. There is only one linecon for both types of badge sales. 

Please help us make this a great experience for everyone by following directions given by goons. After human registration opens, there may be one line for all of registration, or there may be two lines (one for online sales (pre-registration) and one for cash sales). This may also change over time, based on available staffing and necessary crowd control. We will strive to make it easily understandable in-person as to which line you should join. 

Ways to buy a badge


$560 online purchase until July 18, 2025. Tickets are transferable. Please read the details on the linked page.
$580 online purchase until August 1, 2025. Tickets are transferable. Please read the details on the linked page.
$500 cash purchase on-site.
As part of a BlackHat registration.


Online Purchase

You will be emailed a QR code to the email address provided when you bought your badge. Please guard that QR code as though it is cash -- it can only be redeemed once, and anyone can redeem it if they have it (including a photo of it). Badges are picked-up on-site -- they will not be mailed or shipped.

We can scan the QR code either from your phone's display or from a printed copy. You must have the QR code with you in order to obtain your badge. As you approach the front of the line, if you are going to show your QR code on an electronic device, please ensure that your display is set to maximum brightness. 

If you pre-registered, but ultimately are unable to attend DEF CON and want to cancel your purchase, the only way to get a refund is from the original online source. We are unable to provide any refunds on-site at DEF CON. There is a fee to have your badge canceled: $34 before July 18, and $84 on and after July 18.

Online purchases are provided a receipt via email when the purchase is made.

Online purchase -- often referred to as pre-registration -- does not allow you to skip any line/queue to pick up your badge. Once you arrive on-site, you will need to join the existing line for human registration. There may or may not be a dedicated line for pre-registration badge pickup, depending on when you arrive, how long the line is, available staff, etc.

Cash Purchase

Badges will be available for purchase on-site at DEF CON. All badge sales are cash only. No checks, money orders, credit cards, etc., will be accepted. In order to keep the registration line moving as quickly as possible, please have exact change ready as you near the front of the line.

There are no refunds given for cash sales. If you have any doubt about your desire to buy a badge, please refrain from doing so.

We are unable to provide printed receipts at the time of the sale. A generic receipt for the cash sale of a badge will be made available on media.defcon.org after the conference. You are welcome to print your own copy of the receipt on plain paper.

Via BlackHat

If you've purchased a DEF CON badge as part of your Black Hat registration, you're in luck - you will be able to pick up your DEF CON badge at Black Hat on Thursday.  Please bring your Black Hat badge and watch for emails from Black Hat about where exactly the badge pickup will be.  There will be DEF CON goons at Mandalay at the pickup desk to help out and answer questions.

Please note that DEF CON is not able to access or verify Black Hat registration or attendee info.  DEF CON's preregistration list is not the same as Black Hat's.  For help, ask at Black Hat registration or the concierge area. 

Misc

Want to buy multiple badges? No problem! We're happy to sell you however many badges you want to pay for.

If you lose your badge, there is unfortunately no way for us to replace it. You'll have to buy a replacement at full price. Please don't lose your badge. :( 

If you are being accompanied by a full-time caretaker (such as someone who will push your wheelchair, and will accompany you at all times), please ask to speak to a Registration Goon. Your caretaker will receive a paper badge that will permit them to accompany you everywhere you go.

Still need help?

If you have questions about anything regarding human registration that are not addressed here, please ask to speak to a Registration Goon.

Description:
In this game capture the flag you will be presented with real configurations of real wireless and radio technologies to attack. Practice your skill and learn new ones from Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) through Software Defined Radio (SDR) and up to Bluetooth and WiFi. There may even be Infrared, if you have the eye for it.

RF Hackers Sanctuary is once again holding the Radio Frequency Capture the Flag (RFCTF) at DEF CON 32. RFHS runs this game to teach security concepts and to give people a safe and legal way to practice attacks against new and old wireless technologies.

We cater to both those who are new to radio communications as well as to those who have been playing for a long time. We are looking for inexperienced players on up to the SIGINT secret squirrels to play our games. The RFCTF can be played with a little knowledge, a pen tester's determination, and $0 to $$$$$ worth of special equipment. Our virtual RFCTF can be played completely remotely without needing any specialized equipment at all, just using your web browser! The key is to read the clues, determine the goal of each challenge, and have fun learning.

This game doesn't let you sit still either, as there are numerous fox hunts, testing your skill in tracking various signals. If running around the conference looking for WiFi, Bluetooth, or even a Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) device sounds like fun, we are your source of a higher step count.

There will be clues everywhere, and we will provide periodic updates via discord and twitter. Make sure you pay attention to what's happening at the RFCTF desk, #rfctf on our discord, on Twitter @rf_ctf, @rfhackers, and the interwebz, etc. If you have a question - ASK! We may or may not answer, at our discretion.

This is an All-Points Bulletin for the Las Vegas DEFCON area. Caution. A UFO has been spotted crashing into the nearby landscape. Be on the lookout for an unidentified creature. It is considered unarmed and incredibly dangerous. Eye-witness testimony indicates the space invader answers to "Stitcharoo" or "Experiment #696". The monster appears to be keen on projecting electronic music at uncomfortably loud bass-filled volumes, primarily consisting of the genre Vocal House. Under no circumstances is the alien to be allowed near electronic devices such as turntables, mixers, or other DJ equipment. The creature seems to have a preference for ice cream. Message Repeat. This is an All-Points Bulletin for the Las Vegas DEFCON area. Caution.
