Defcon.run is a beloved tradition at DEF CON, bringing together hackers for a refreshing start to the day. Originally known as the DEF CON 4x5K, the event has evolved into a distributed, community-driven experience featuring fun runs and rucks across Las Vegas. Participants can choose from various routes, ranging from simple 5Ks to more ambitious distances.

For DEF CON 33, the gathering point is "The Spot" by the North Entrance of the Las Vegas Convention Center West Hall. Here, the real wild hares gather before the sun has a chance to burn up this city of sin. The runs kick off at 06:00 Thursday through Sunday! But be there early for hype talks and shenanigans. We also have a whole new Meshtastic setup and website features we're adding. There are other runs swag drops and social meetups planned throughout the day and night as well!

Whether you're a seasoned runner or looking for something different, defcon.run offers a unique way to connect with other hackers and kick off your day. For more details and to sign up, visit defcon.run.

Description:
Every year, electronic badges light up DEF CON, sparking creativity, community, and curiosity. But behind the blinking LEDs and clever puzzles are questions we rarely ask: How safe is this badge for its users? What's its environmental footprint? In this talk, we'll dive into the design of "The SEC Village Badge" from concept to execution - but more importantly, we'll explore a proposed framework for badge makers to disclose key safety information and environmental impact of their creation. From battery safety considerations and materials selection to end-of-life recycling and disposal, we'll discuss how transparency can empower the community, inspire more responsible design, and keep the badge life culture thriving sustainably. Whether you're a seasoned hardware hacker, a first-time badge maker, or just curious about what goes into creating these wearable works of art, this talk will challenge us to think beyond the soldering iron and consider the broader impact of our creations.

SpeakerBio:  Brent "TheDukeZip" Dukes
Brent is a long time hacker and DEF CON attendee that has designed various electronic badges throughout the years. He may be the all time champion at coming in second place in DEF CON competitions (but let's be honest, he'd probably turn out to be second place in that too!)

Description:
Our human registration process this year will be very similar to previous years. Please be patient. All of the times listed here are approximate. 

Basics

Who needs a badge?

A badge is required for each human age 8 and older.

Human?

You are a human if you do not know otherwise. People that are not humans include goons, official speaker, village/community/contest/creator staff, press, black badge holders, or similar. If you are not a human, you need to register separately. If you don't know how, see an NFO goon (NFO Node, formerly known as an infobooth, is where you can get help). The remainder of this message applies only to humans.

Lines? Linecon?

Linecon is your optional opportunity to stand (or sit) in line for human registration to open. Doors will open for linecon on Wednesday at approximately 17:00. When human registration opens on Thursday at approximately 08:00, they start working the linecon queue, and the line will start moving quickly. (Please understand that we will begin processing the line on Thursday morning as soon as the cashiers and materials are in place; we will strive for Thursday 08:00, but actual start may be slightly earlier or later.)

Online badge purchase (aka pre-registration) has no impact on linecon. You can join the line on Wednesday (if you wish) regardless of whether you purchased a badge online or intend to pay with cash. There is only one linecon for both types of badge sales. 

Please help us make this a great experience for everyone by following directions given by goons. After human registration opens, there may be one line for all of registration, or there may be two lines (one for online sales (pre-registration) and one for cash sales). This may also change over time, based on available staffing and necessary crowd control. We will strive to make it easily understandable in-person as to which line you should join. 

Ways to buy a badge


$560 online purchase until July 18, 2025. Tickets are transferable. Please read the details on the linked page.
$580 online purchase until August 1, 2025. Tickets are transferable. Please read the details on the linked page.
$500 cash purchase on-site.
As part of a BlackHat registration.


Online Purchase

You will be emailed a QR code to the email address provided when you bought your badge. Please guard that QR code as though it is cash -- it can only be redeemed once, and anyone can redeem it if they have it (including a photo of it). Badges are picked-up on-site -- they will not be mailed or shipped.

We can scan the QR code either from your phone's display or from a printed copy. You must have the QR code with you in order to obtain your badge. As you approach the front of the line, if you are going to show your QR code on an electronic device, please ensure that your display is set to maximum brightness. 

If you pre-registered, but ultimately are unable to attend DEF CON and want to cancel your purchase, the only way to get a refund is from the original online source. We are unable to provide any refunds on-site at DEF CON. There is a fee to have your badge canceled: $34 before July 18, and $84 on and after July 18.

Online purchases are provided a receipt via email when the purchase is made.

Online purchase -- often referred to as pre-registration -- does not allow you to skip any line/queue to pick up your badge. Once you arrive on-site, you will need to join the existing line for human registration. There may or may not be a dedicated line for pre-registration badge pickup, depending on when you arrive, how long the line is, available staff, etc.

Cash Purchase

Badges will be available for purchase on-site at DEF CON. All badge sales are cash only. No checks, money orders, credit cards, etc., will be accepted. In order to keep the registration line moving as quickly as possible, please have exact change ready as you near the front of the line.

There are no refunds given for cash sales. If you have any doubt about your desire to buy a badge, please refrain from doing so.

We are unable to provide printed receipts at the time of the sale. A generic receipt for the cash sale of a badge will be made available on media.defcon.org after the conference. You are welcome to print your own copy of the receipt on plain paper.

Via BlackHat

If you've purchased a DEF CON badge as part of your Black Hat registration, you're in luck - you will be able to pick up your DEF CON badge at Black Hat on Thursday.  Please bring your Black Hat badge and watch for emails from Black Hat about where exactly the badge pickup will be.  There will be DEF CON goons at Mandalay at the pickup desk to help out and answer questions.

Please note that DEF CON is not able to access or verify Black Hat registration or attendee info.  DEF CON's preregistration list is not the same as Black Hat's.  For help, ask at Black Hat registration or the concierge area. 

Misc

Want to buy multiple badges? No problem! We're happy to sell you however many badges you want to pay for.

If you lose your badge, there is unfortunately no way for us to replace it. You'll have to buy a replacement at full price. Please don't lose your badge. :( 

If you are being accompanied by a full-time caretaker (such as someone who will push your wheelchair, and will accompany you at all times), please ask to speak to a Registration Goon. Your caretaker will receive a paper badge that will permit them to accompany you everywhere you go.

Still need help?

If you have questions about anything regarding human registration that are not addressed here, please ask to speak to a Registration Goon.

Description:
Software supply chain attacks are out of control! Between 2019 and 2023 software supply chain attacks increased by more than 740% year on year. Things have only gotten worse since then, with attacks like Bybit, Ultralytics, LottieFiles, Polyfills, and of course XZ utils happening in the last 18 months. But how are these supply chain attacks delivered? Often, the attack starts with a malicious npm package.

According to Sonatype, 98.5% of malicious software packages exist in the npm registry. There are several reasons that npm is particularly well suited for delivering malware, and that's why I chose to focus just on npm for this 4 hour workshop.

This hands-on workshop will teach both software engineers, and infosec practitioners how npm malware works. Weâll learn what makes npm malware unique from other software package malware, and how the author has been using his knowledge of npm malware in his research, and to deliver unique offensive security engagements. Most importantly how to identify, analyze, create and defend against malicious NPM packages in this workshop.

The trainer for this workshop, Paul McCarty, is literally writing the book on the subject âHacking npmâ, so he will drop lots of in-depth, never before seen npm techniques.

SpeakerBio:  Paul "6mile" McCarty, Head of Research at Safety
Paul is the Head of Research at Safety (safetycli.com) and a DevSecOps OG. He loves software supply chain research and delivering supply chain offensive security training and engagements.

Description:
Using cryptography is often a subtle practice and mistakes can result in significant vulnerabilities. This workshop will cover many of these vulnerabilities which have shown up in the real world, including CVE-2020-0601. This will be a hands-on workshop where you will implement the attacks after each one is explained. I will provide a VM with a tool written in Python to execute the attacks. A good way to determine if this workshop is for you is to look at the challenges at cryptopals.com and see if those look interesting, but you could use in person help understanding the attacks. While not a strict subset of those challenges, there is significant overlap. The exercises will range from decrypting ciphertext to recovering private keys from public key attacks allowing us to create TLS cert private key and ssh private key files.

SpeakerBio:  Matt Cheung
Matt Cheung started developing his interest in cryptography during an internship in 2011. He worked on implementation of a secure multi-party protocol by adding elliptic curve support to an existing secure text pattern matching protocol. Implementation weaknesses were not a priority and this concerned Matt. This concern prompted him to learn about cryptographic attacks from Dan Boneh's crypto 1 course offered on Coursera and the Matasano/cryptopals challenges.

Description:
Browser extensions have quietly become one of the most underappreciated attack surfaces. While marketed as productivity enhancers, many of these extensions operate with elevated privileges that rival native malware in terms of access to sensitive user and organizational data.

This hands-on workshop takes a deep dive into how browser extensions operate under the hood and exposes how easily legitimate APIs can be weaponized to exfiltrate credentials, hijack sessions, monitor user behavior, and leak sensitive corporate information. By reverse-engineering real-world extension behavior and building functioning proof-of-concept (PoC) malicious extensions, participants will gain a direct understanding of the risks these extensions pose.

Through practical exercises, participants will:
- Learn the browser extension architecture and permission model
- Examine key APIs commonly misused for surveillance or data theft
- Build PoC malicious extensions that exfiltrate session cookies, read passwords, record keystrokes, capture DOM content, and more
- Analyze techniques for stealth, obfuscation, and evasion
- Explore detection blind spots in endpoint and SSE security tools
- Review mitigation strategies and enterprise hardening recommendations

Description:
SAMLSmith is the go-to tool for penetrating SAML applications with response forging. An evolution of the original tooling developed for proof-of-concept of SAML response forging in Entra ID, SAMLSmith is the product of continued research on SAML. While far from new, enterprises continue to not prioritize the security of how SaaS applications integrate or understand best practices for securing them. With many factors at play, SAML response forging can range from extremely difficult to near impossible for a SOC to detect. SAMLSmith has a lot of tricks up its sleeve, including: [1] Multiple identity provider response forging. [2] AD FS specific response forging mode. [3] SAML request processing. [4] InResponseTo support. SAMLSmith can be used in several response forging scenarios where the private key material can be obtained. In demonstration of use, weâÃÃ´ll explore using SAMLSmith for performing a Golden SAML attack against AD FS. Further, weâÃÃ´ll demonstrate the use of SAMLSmith that ties into new research around response forging, penetrating certain types of SaaS applications with even more stealth.

Choose your side!

Blue Team
You are assigned to the Cybersecurity Team servicing four Regional Airports within the IG Labs Regional Airport System. The shift this evening started with routine checking status boards, reviewing threat alerts, and checking for any newly identified vulnerabilities that may have an impact on the system from both Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) vectors.

Around midnight, chaos ensues! Runway lighting is turning off at your airport and others nearby, planes are circling waiting to land or diverting to other locations. You must regain access to your systems, find the problem, and restore operation to the Runway Lighting Control System quickly and ensure that the other regional airports your team is responsible for do not lose control of their systems and operations are able to continue without interruption.

Red Team(s)
Cybersecurity Teams are often heavily focused on securing Information Technology (IT) systems and devices but may not consider securing Operational Technology (OT) systems and devices. While OT systems and devices may be connected to IT systems, the type of data and protocols are different.

You start your day exploring OT system vulnerabilities and consider what chaos you could create. You see a report that the runway lighting system at one of the IG Labs Regional Airports has been compromised. You start researching to learn more about the attack and the IG Labs Regional Airport System. Satisfied that you have learned enough to add to the madness that has been created at La Valoria, you decide to launch an attack of your own.

Success will be determined by the ability to disrupt the control and operations of the Runway Lighting Systems for the IG Labs Regional Airports at the OT level. DoS and DDoS attacks are not permitted as the intent is to demonstrate an understanding of OT systems, their functionality, and protocols.

Description:
Fewer than 500 of npm's top 10,000 most downloaded packages have one or more disclosed vulnerabilities, which is not surprising considering that the ratio of open source packages to known vulnerabilities is less than 0.5%. In this talk, we will discuss why current OSS vulnerability discovery efforts are falling short, addressing common mistakes made by open source maintainers, the challenges of scaled security scanning, and the shortcomings of todayâs open source bug bounty programs. To conclude, I'll propose a transition from crowdsourced bug hunting to crowdsourced triaging, emphasizing how often repository issues, OSS-Fuzz crash reports, and similar findings go untriaged, despite being publicly available and there potential to reveal (undisclosed) critical security risks.

Imagine trying to secure your facilities, water, power, communication, while your so-called âalliesâ across the table spot every vulnerability you missed. And you? You're doing the same to them. In this game, you'll simulate cyber attacks, defend your systems, and learn how breaches ripple through networks, all through fast-paced, strategic play based on real-world incidents like the Maroochy Water hack and the Kyiv power grid attack.

ð Who Should Play?


Newcomers curious about cybersecurity
Security pros who like strategy games
Engineers, students, and defenders looking to sharpen their threat modeling skills
DEF CON attendees who want a break from screens and a seat at the table


ð¯ What Youâll Learn


How attacks link to defenses
Why mitigation doesnât always come fast enough
How weak points in one system compromise others
What âlateral movementâ actually looks like
â
âð§  More Than a Game


accessDenied isn't just for fun, itâs designed to educate non-cybersecurity players and create smarter conversations about digital threats to critical infrastructure. Whether you're a hacker, a healthcare nerd, or just want to try something new, this tabletop challenge belongs in your DEF CON lineup.

SpeakerBio:  Jack Voltaic, RIT
United States military installations and their surrounding communities share an interest in the resiliency of cyber-critical infrastructure systems. In addition to civil-military interdependencies, a failure in one critical infrastructure sector can cause cascading effects across others. ACI launched the Jack Voltaic (JV) initiative to address gaps and build resilience. Beginning with the first exercise (JV 1.0) in 2016, these exercises addressed multi-sector cyber-critical infrastructure challenges.

Civil-military
Local, community level
Multi-sector
Unclassified

With JV 4.0, ACIâs critical infrastructure resilience program will mature and transition. Through partnerships with other academic and policy communities, ACI seeks to foster the growth of JV-inspired practices. Multiple initiatives through 2025 will build upon the momentum and lessons of JV 1.0 - 3.0.

Description:
Sector Down is a high-stakes, immersive multiplayer card game where critical infrastructure and cybersecurity collide. Designed for teams of 5, 10, 15, or 20 players, this simulation pits defenders and attackers against each other in a race against the inevitable: The Doom Clock.

ð¡ï¸Defend or Disrupt

Players are divided into two sides:
- Blue Team â Critical infrastructure defenders. Each Blue player manages a sector with three vital facilities: Physical, Network, and Financial. Their mission? Keep the systems alive and online while working together to run out the clock.
- Red Team â Offensive disruptors. Red players attempt to take down facilities using calculated cyberattacks and chaos tactics. Their goal: force sector collapses and trigger the Doom Clock.

â±ï¸ Time-Based Tactics

The game progresses in strategic phases where players draw cards, take action using worker tokens, and discard based on hand limits. Watch out for unpredictable âWhite Playsâârandom game events that add surprise twists every few rounds.

ð¥ The Doom Clock

When half of all sectors or any core sectors go down, the Doom Clock starts ticking. Teams must respond fast: Blue must recover systems before the countdown hits zero, or Red claims victory.

ð¤ Team Dynamics


Worker Sharing: Blue teammates can lend each other resources in bonus phases.
Overtime Mechanics: When the pressureâs on, Blue players can double down on effortâwith the tradeoff of worker exhaustion in future turns.


ð® Why You Should Play


Dive into a realistic cybersecurity crisis.
Learn how interdependent systems behave under attack.
Collaborate and compete with hackers, healthcare defenders, and critical infrastructure enthusiasts.
Engage with a visually rich map interface and fast-paced card dynamics.


Whether you're a strategist, a chaos agent, or just love competitive simulation, Sector Down challenges your mind and your teamwork. Can your team hold the line or will your sector go dark?â Come play during DEF CON 33.

Tags: Biohacking Village | Creator Talk/Panel
When: Friday, Aug 8, 10:30 - 10:59 PDT

Description:
Hospitals and trauma centers face critical delays in triage, patient monitoring, and shift handoffsâleading to avoidable medical errors, increased wait times, and compromised patient safety. What if AI-powered triage, biometrics, and AI-driven simulation labs could change that?
This talk explores how biometric AI, smart bedside displays, digital handoff systems, and AI physiology simulations can enhance emergency care, reduce human error, and revolutionize medical training.
Key Innovations Weâll Unpack:
1.        AI-Facial Recognition: Upon entry to the hospital/facility, AI-powered sensors take a real-time picture of each patient as they walk/check into the ED and sync the biometric picture with their Medical Record Number (MRN) patient chart.
2.        AI-Powered Biometric Triage: AI sensors continue to scan patients in the waiting room, analyzing vital signs (HR, respiratory rate, O2 sat, temp), non-verbal distress like bleeding (trauma), pain based on facial droop (Stroke), chest pain or shortness of breath (Heart Attack), syncope, labor/delivery, and grimacing (pain), and factor all these into the Emergency Severity Index (ESI) algorithm for a real-time comprehensive display to triage staff for their review. 
3.        Digital Handoff Reporting: Automated shift changes summaries ensure that critical patient data like medical and surgical history, labs, vital trends, pending orders, isolation precautions, and risk factors are not lost between clinicians. It also reduces paper waste, redundancy, and inefficiencies like report duration. 
4.        Digital Smart Room Display (i.e. TV): Like at a nice hotel room, your patient room tv would provide you with a personalized channel with your real-time medical updates (aka tv medical chart), that are approved by your providers, that are synced to your EHR chart and secured with a personalized pin you created during registration. Upon discharge of the hospital, your channel would be deactivated. This would enhance the time from provider-to-patient communication, decrease patient wait times for results, and ensure healthcare treatment transparency. It is optional and on-demand for the patient and family if consent is given by the patient. 
5.        AI Physiology in Simulation Labs: AI-driven simulated patient models that replicate real-time human physiology, responses to trauma, medication interactions, and disease progressionâtransforming medical education.
6.        Cybersecurity in AI-Driven Emergency Care: Protecting biometric patient data, preventing AI hallucinations and poisoning, and securing AI-driven training systems.
By integrating AI-driven biometrics, automating bedside displays and handoff reports, and AI physiology in healthcare, we can prioritize critical patients faster, reduce handoff errors, and accelerate healthcare education. The future of emergency care isnât just faster, itâs predictive, automated, and cybersecure.

Description:
How much do you trust your cloud provider to hide the ownership information for your resources? Many organizations believe that their ownership information for cloud hosted resources is not available to anonymous users. Unless there's an associated DNS record or other obvious identifiers (website content, SSL certificates, etc.), it might seem difficult to anonymously identify a cloud resourceâs owner. What if we told you that some of your Azure resources can expose their ownership information? 
This talk will explain how multiple Azure resource types (and Microsoft services) inadvertently expose their ownership information, allowing attackers to enumerate potential entry points into an Azure tenant. Thanks to the supporting structure of Azure resource subdomains, and public DNS data sources, we enumerated the ownership information of over 500,000 Azure resources. 
We will wrap things up by sharing a new tool (ATEAM - Azure Tenant Enumeration and Attribution Module) that can be used to replicate our research, so you too can find out where all of your Azure resources have been hiding.

Cloud environments are vast, complex, and often opaqueâeven to their owners. In this talk, we expose how AWSâs design decisions around default service roles and resource naming patterns created hidden privilege escalation paths that could lead to full AWS account takeover.

We begin by introducing the concept of Shadow ResourcesâS3 buckets automatically relied upon by internal AWS services, which users donât create or control directly, but are referenced implicitly. We show how attackers could preemptively claim these buckets in unused regions using predictable naming conventions (like aws-glue-assets-{AccountID}-{Region}), planting malicious content or intercepting trusted workflows. This silent hijacking technique breaks the assumed isolation between services and accounts.

From there, we pivot to Shadow Rolesâdefault IAM roles created or recommended by AWS services such as SageMaker, Glue, and EMR. These roles often come with dangerously over-permissive policies (e.g., AmazonS3FullAccess). With these roles in place, any compromised service becomes a launchpad: we demonstrate how importing a single malicious Hugging Face model into SageMaker enables an attacker to silently backdoor Glue jobs across the entire account by tampering with trusted S3.

Finally, we share findings from our AWS Glue research, where we discovered that the /etc/passwd file was writable within the container environment, enabling local privilege escalation to root. From there, we were able to extract the real IAM credentials assigned to the underlying managed service instance via IMDSv2âcredentials that belonged to AWSâs internal Glue account. These credentials granted access to sensitive internal APIs and allowed enumeration of infrastructure metadata across other users, demonstrating that the managed runtime could serve as an unexpected vector for privilege escalation and cross-tenant exposure.

This layered attack pathâfrom shadow resources to shadow roles to breaking the runtime isolation of managed servicesâdemonstrates a critical but overlooked risk in cloud architecture.

In this talk, weâll share how our investigation began with a single misconfigured resource and evolved into a broader exploration of AWS's internal service trust model. Weâll walk through the methodology that helped us uncover these vulnerabilities and highlight how each discovery opened the door to the nextâusing specific privilege escalation techniques to chain across services and amplify impact. Expect a technical deep dive, real-world attack flows, and a new lens on how seemingly isolated misconfigurations can lead to complete compromise.

PROJECT ACCESS: A Fox Hunt in the Shadows

The last surviving fragments of Project ACCESS, a defunct open comms initiative, have resurfaced. The faceless OmniCorp thought they had erased it from the spectrum, but rogue operatives are pushing back. Disguised among the DEF CON crowd, Foxes are carrying the pieces needed to reboot the system.

Theyâre broadcasting open signals across the con space. Your job? Track them down, follow the trail, and recover the payloads. Some Foxes are stationary. Others are on the move. All of them have something you needâbut they wonât just hand it over. Youâll have to answer DEF CON trivia, solve puzzles, or earn their trust in creative ways.

This isnât a gear-only hunt. Whether youâre rocking SDRs, handheld radios, or just tuned into the right frequency, youâve got a shot. Itâs part signal chase, part real-world goose chase, and 100% hacker weirdness.

Expect:
- Live human Foxes broadcasting short-range signals
- Some Foxes roaming the con floor hunt them down, respectfully
- DEF CON history questions, crypto puzzles, and maybe a social engineering twist or two
- Physical items or clues exchanged when you succeed
- No encryption. No gatekeeping. Just old school radio and clever chaos.

Think you can track the signal, crack the code, and restore the last breath of open access?

Then grab your gear, tune in, and start hunting.

Participant Prerequisites

RF Fox Hunt(s): To participate in the RF fox hunt(s), you will need a radio or scanner that can receive signals in the 2m and/or 70cm Amateur Radio Bands (144.000 MHz - 148.000 MHz, 420.000 MHz - 450.000 MHz).

RF Hackers Sanctuary is once again holding the Radio Frequency Capture the Flag (RFCTF) at DEF CON 32. RFHS runs this game to teach security concepts and to give people a safe and legal way to practice attacks against new and old wireless technologies.

We cater to both those who are new to radio communications as well as to those who have been playing for a long time. We are looking for inexperienced players on up to the SIGINT secret squirrels to play our games. The RFCTF can be played with a little knowledge, a pen tester's determination, and $0 to $$$$$ worth of special equipment. Our virtual RFCTF can be played completely remotely without needing any specialized equipment at all, just using your web browser! The key is to read the clues, determine the goal of each challenge, and have fun learning.

This game doesn't let you sit still either, as there are numerous fox hunts, testing your skill in tracking various signals. If running around the conference looking for WiFi, Bluetooth, or even a Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) device sounds like fun, we are your source of a higher step count.

There will be clues everywhere, and we will provide periodic updates via discord and twitter. Make sure you pay attention to what's happening at the RFCTF desk, #rfctf on our discord, on Twitter @rf_ctf, @rfhackers, and the interwebz, etc. If you have a question - ASK! We may or may not answer, at our discretion.

Description:
Cryptographic random number generators are a critical part of many deployed cryptosystems. When they fail, so does the cryptography. So why leave their security to chance?

Yet, over the past two decades, researchers have discovered vulnerabilities in numerous widely deployed algorithms and implementations designed to produce secure random numbersâall derived from supposedly vetted standards!

If you're more conspiratorially minded, you suspect some foul play.

This talk draws on Shaananâs work discovering many of the CVEs and vulns to find that behind each one is the hint of an under-discussed flavour of adversary: one who subtly threads flaws into our standards.

SpeakerBio:  Shaanan Cohney
Dr. Shaanan Cohney is the Deputy Head of the School of Computing and Information Systems at the University of Melbourne. Coming from the security community, his research attempts to use a wide variety of traditional computer science research techniques to address problems in public policy.

Description:
In Windows, the cornerstone of data protection is BitLocker, a Full Volume Encryption technology designed to secure sensitive data on disk. This ensures that even if an adversary gains physical access to the device, the data remains secure and inaccessible.

One of the critical aspects of any data protection feature is its ability to support recovery operations failure cases. To support BitLocker recovery, design changes were applied in the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE). This led us to a pivotal question: did these changes introduce new attack surfaces impacting BitLocker? 

In this talk, we will share our journey of researching a fascinating and mysterious component: WinRE. Our exploration begins with an overview of the WinRE architecture, followed by a retrospective analysis of the attack surfaces exposed with the introduction of BitLocker. We will then discuss our methodology for effectively researching and exploiting these exposed attack surfaces. Our presentation will reveal how we identified multiple 0-day vulnerabilities and developed fully functional exploits, enabling us to bypass BitLocker and extract all protected data in several different ways.

Finally, we will share the insights Microsoft gained from this research and explain our approach to hardening WinRE, which in turn strengthens BitLocker.

Description:
Modern web applications donât just expose APIs, they expose attack paths. Recursive Request Exploits (RRE) are a new class of attack that weaponizes interdependent web requests to systematically bypass authentication, authorization, and payment controls.

This talk introduces RRE, a methodology that automates recursive request discovery, maps hidden relationships between API and web calls, and exploits overlooked logic flaws. Using a real-world case study, weâll show how this technique was used to bypass premium paywalls on a major streaming platform without requiring authentication or hacking DRM.

But this isnât just a one-off streaming exploit, RRE exposes a fundamental flaw in how checkout logic is enforced across e-commerce and digital subscriptions. By chaining requests together in unintended ways, attackers can exploit blind spots in authentication, entitlement, and payment flows to gain unauthorized access. What was once considered security through obscurity is now an active attack surface.

Weâll release exploit code, via a Burp Suite extension, that automates RRE discovery and exploitation, giving security professionals the tools to both weaponize and defend against these attacks.

Description:
OPC UA is a standardized communication protocol that is widely used in the areas of industrial automation and IoT. It is used within and between OT networks, but also as a bridge between IT and OT environments or to connect field systems with the cloud. Traditionally, VPN tunnels are used to secure connections between OT trust zones (especially when they cross the internet), but this is often considered not to be neccessary when using OPC UA because the protocol offers its own cryptographic authentication and transport security layer.

This makes OPC UA a valuable target for attackers, because if they could hijack an OPC UA server they might be able to wreak havoc on whatever industrial systems are controlled by it. 

I decided to take a look at the cryptography used by the protocol, and managed to identify two protocol flaws which I could turn into practical authentication bypass attacks that worked against various implementations and configurations. These attacks involve signing oracles, signature spoofing padding oracles and turning "RSA-ECB" into a "timing side channel amplifier".

In this talk, I will explore the protocols and the issues I identified, as well as the process of turning two theoretical crypto flaws into highly practical exploits.

Description:
SAMLSmith is the go-to tool for penetrating SAML applications with response forging. An evolution of the original tooling developed for proof-of-concept of SAML response forging in Entra ID, SAMLSmith is the product of continued research on SAML. While far from new, enterprises continue to not prioritize the security of how SaaS applications integrate or understand best practices for securing them. With many factors at play, SAML response forging can range from extremely difficult to near impossible for a SOC to detect. SAMLSmith has a lot of tricks up its sleeve, including: [1] Multiple identity provider response forging. [2] AD FS specific response forging mode. [3] SAML request processing. [4] InResponseTo support. SAMLSmith can be used in several response forging scenarios where the private key material can be obtained. In demonstration of use, weâÃÃ´ll explore using SAMLSmith for performing a Golden SAML attack against AD FS. Further, weâÃÃ´ll demonstrate the use of SAMLSmith that ties into new research around response forging, penetrating certain types of SaaS applications with even more stealth.

When: Friday, Aug 8, 10:00 - 10:30 PDT
Where: LVCC West-Level 2-W233 (Creator Stage 1) - Map

Description:
Every time the lights go out, the speculation beginsâwas it cyber? Squirrels? Was it an attack? But often, the real story behind grid disturbances isnât malicious codeâitâs uncontrolled chaos, born from the physical behavior of a rapidly evolving power system.
This session takes a deep dive into that chaos, exploring how subtle interactions in electric gridsâlike oscillationsâcan spiral into large-scale instability. These low-frequency oscillations are increasingly common in the bulk electric system, yet are explainable. They emerge from control design, network conditions, and energy physicsânot adversarial action, and the lights going off is usually a sign the system has actually acted as it should in protecting itself from damage. Equipment failures are also spectacular,  but common.   Its tempting to tie big fires to bad cyber,  but in reality â the failures are almost always in the planning for the event, or recovery. 
Weâll dissect real-world events like the Iberian Peninsula blackout, where what looked like a grid failure may have actually revealed a quiet success: a functional blackstart scenario, where system operators re-energized the grid under extreme stress. But that nuance was lost in the noise, as media and analysts scrambled for cyber scapegoats. Weâll also explore the London transformer fire, a failure in planning for an outage,  and technical scrutiny of Chinese-manufactured inverter components with alleged kill switches inserted, illustrating how physical system dynamicsâoften create the most dramatic disruptions.
This talk fuses power system engineering, ICS cybersecurity, and operational storytelling to reframe how we interpret complex events. Itâs a call to replace fear with factsâand to find meaning in the chaos, not just blame.

This is the story of how Malware Village, Malmons aka Malware Monsters, and everything good that followed came into existence â all sparked by the Big BAN. In early 2024, after standing up for others, I was banned and ostracized from the local cybersecurity communities in my home country. At the time, I had never spoken at a conference outside that community â I hadnât even attended DEF CON as an attendee. At first, it felt like the end of everything, because that local community meant the world to me back then. But then I stopped and asked myself:

âWhy not create my own world â one filled with light?ââ¨
âI shall shine bright to light the way, even in the darkest night.â
The best revenge is to shine bright and live your best life.
Now, let there be light â in the world of bits and bytes.

InfoSecMap was created to solve this. Itâs a free, community-driven platform that brings the global InfoSec ecosystem together in one place. From major conferences to CTFs and grassroots meetups, InfoSecMap helps users explore whatâs happening by geographic region or focus area and discover where they can connect and contribute.

Description:
You know how to secure and break systems - but what about the laws and policies that govern them? Whether you like it or not, cybersecurity is now deeply entangled with law and politics. Governments are making decisions about encryption, vulnerability disclosure, surveillance, and the limits of offensive operations - decisions that shape what you can build, break, publish, or patch.
What you need is a fast-paced, no-jargon-needed crash course in cyber policy, designed specifically for DEF CON attendees. We'll start early: the crypto wars (no, not that crypto), hacking laws, and security research. From there, we'll look at how todayâs key institutions - legislatures, federal agencies, international coalitions - are approaching the future of cybersecurity. Topics include the debate over vulnerability disclosure and use, efforts to regulate encryption and mandate software security, the evolving norms of state-sponsored hacking, AI policyâs impact on cybersecurity, post-quantum encryption, and conflicts over digital sovereignty. Finally, weâll cover how you can engage on these debates.
If you've ever found yourself yelling at a Congressional hearing on C-SPAN or ignoring it entirely, this talk will help you understand how the levers of cyber policy work - and how you can hack them, too.

Description:
Over the past decade and a half, the tactics of threat actors have quietly but fundamentally transformed. What began as slow, targeted intelligence gathering has evolved into automated, scalable exploitation of exposed assetsâoften before defenders even notice. In this keynote, weâll trace the journey of threat actor innovation, highlighting shifts in recon methods, asset targeting, and speed of attack. Weâll dissect common attack surface mistakes that open the door for breaches, especially in the last couple of years, and challenge assumptions around visibility and control. The attack surface is always in motionâare you keeping up?

Tags: Recon Village | Creator Talk/Panel
When: Friday, Aug 8, 10:50 - 11:35 PDT
Where: LVCC West-Level 1-Exhibit Hall 2-603 (Recon Village)-Talks Area - Map

Description:
Open-source intelligence in Discord may seem surface level. Some techniques include searching through chat history using search operators similar to Google dorking and reviewing a userâs profile to look for any linked accounts tied to their Discord account. Going beyond this and analyze the servers that a user is a part of, more assumptions and inferences can be made based on those servers. I applied what I saw and experienced with Student Hubs and applied it to cybersecurity within Discord. The information from knowing what cybersecurity servers a person is in informed me of what their experience level was, the type of field they were interested / worked in, and potentially even where they lived.x000D
x000D
However, you can only reach a certain point by joining servers within Discord. This type of approach can only be done at scale and this presents its own set of problems. Scaling this seemed unlikely to happen until a service known as Spy.pet was publicly disclosed in April 2024. Spy.pet was marketed as a data broker that was inadvertently a very capable OSINT tool that could be used for Discord. Knowing that it would be available for a short time before it got shut down, I was able to access Spy.pet to use and document what capabilities it had. Since then, there have been more data scrapers that have appeared with their own reasons. These include third-parties (malicious or not), academic researchers, and cybercrime groups. I will cover the capabilities and OPSEC failures from some of the data scrapers in the past year as well as how it could possibly be approached in the future. Most importantly, I will go over protections at the user and server level.

Hi, Iâm Megan Allen.

My work focuses on a holistic approach to health; moving the bodyâs natural energy into alignment with Earth and the seven chakras. I practice integrative wellness - honoring a person's emotional, mental, physical and spiritual well-being. I provide intuitive healing sessions and work with clients to relax the mind, increase body awareness and balance energy flow.

I also facilitate community wellness workshops, ceremonies and transformational group programs inviting participants to disconnect from their busy lives, turn inward and tap into the present to restore and maintain the bodyâs energetic balance and cultivate self-love, empowerment and sovereignty.

I inspire people to activate their highest potential in alignment with their wise hearts and to promote healing from within. I tailor my sessions to reflect this; using techniques from my healing disciplines as well as my love for Traditional Chinese Medicine, holistic aromatherapy, crystals and essential oils, tarot, animal medicine cards and a deep reverence for nature.

Nature is one of my greatest teachers. It constantly teaches me about grounding, stability, resilience, boundaries, growth, and stillness.

Where: LVCC West-Level 1-Exhibit Hall 2-604 (AppSec Village)-Main Stage - Map

Description:
Weâre stuck in a cycle of bug bounties, vulnerability reports, and endless patching - yet the same issues keep resurfacing. Even after years of "shifting left", vulnerabilities still reach production, keeping security teams in firefighting mode.

What if we could eliminate entire bug classes instead of fixing them one by one?

This talk explores how modern browser security features can automate and scale protection - without relying solely on developers to remember best practices. Opt-in mechanisms like Content Security Policy v3, Trusted Types, and Sec-Fetch-Metadata offer powerful defenses against XSS, CSRF, clickjacking, and cross-origin attacks.

We'll show how these new, underused browser capabilities - which simply didnât exist a few years ago - enable secure-by-default architectures. Real-world examples will demonstrate practical integration strategies, automated security headers, secure defaults, and ways to track adoption and impact. 

SpeakerBio:  Javan Rasokat, Application Security Architect and Security Researcher

Description:
This talk presents a streamlined approach to Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) in the Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SSDLC). By integrating DAST directly into existing Selenium-based web tests and using ZAProxy, the traditional complex setup - such as URL parsing and authentication - is avoided. 
The proposed method leverages functional test coverage to better isolate vulnerabilities and simplifies setup by configuring the proxy in browser features. 
This integration provides earlier security feedback and increases the efficiency of vulnerability detection compared to traditional spider-based testing, proving it to be a more practical and effective alternative.

Description:
Abstract:
As FIN groups continue to execute fast-impact ransomware campaigns, Nation-State APT's prefer long-term infrastructure control, and in both instances: hypervisors have become the new high ground. This talk will explore a set of stealthy and reliable persistence techniques targeting VMware ESXi, developed and refined through our hands-on research and real-world incident analysis.

Iâll break down five practical persistence mechanisms that allow adversaries to remain resident in virtualized environments (even through reboots, patching cycles, and partial remediation efforts). These include:

â¢        Payload injection via local.sh and profile.local
â¢        Malicious services in /etc/init.d
â¢        Symlink hijacking of trusted binaries (like esxcli)
â¢        Custom VIB (vSphere Installation Bundle) creation and implantation

While some of these techniques have been observed in malware families like BadVIBes, VIRTUALPITA, and VIRTUALPIE, a couple others represent novel techniques weâve weaponized in our lab environments but remain largely unobserved in the wild. Every approach is designed to leverage Living-off-the-Land (LOTL) native binaries and config paths, turning ESXiâs minimalism into an attackerâs advantage.

This talk will walk through each method with technical depth, LOTL payload examples, and visual demonstrations. Iâll also explore follow-on actions post-compromise such as ESXi firewall manipulation/DNS reconfiguration to facilitate stable C2 channels.
If you're responsible for red team ops, adversary emulation, or just curious how attackers achieve deep infrastructure persistence, this session will show you a few different ways to persist beneath the hypervisor.

Description:
Virtualization Based Security (VBS) is one of the most fascinating security advancements of recent years - the ability to isolate critical components of the OS enabled Microsoft to achieve substantial security improvements with features like Credential Guard and HVCI. 

One of the more interesting features enabled through VBS are VBS Enclaves - a technology that allows a process to isolate a region of its memory, making it completely inaccessible to other processes, the process itself, and even the kernel. 

While VBS enclaves can have a wide range of security applications, they can also be very appealing to attackers - running malware in an isolated region, out of the reach of EDRs and security analysts? Sign us up! 

With this research we set out to explore the concept of enclave malware. We will dive into VBS enclaves while exploring previously undocumented behaviors, and describe the different scenarios that can enable attackers to run malicious code inside enclaves.

We will then work towards weaponizing VBS enclaves - we will describe the different techniques that could be used by malware running within enclaves, and show how they enable creating stealthy implants that can go completely undetected.

A long time ago, browsers were wrappers for HTTP web requests and little else. The modern browser, however, is crammed with so many features that it is practically an operating system. This talk will demonstrate how to (ab)use years of legacy features along with recent additions to Google Chrome to mimic the capabilities of a conventional C2 implant while evading traditional endpoint protection.

We will introduce our new open-source framework "ChromeAlone" which implements features such as proxying raw TCP traffic, phishing for Yubikey USB codes, dumping cookies and credentials, keylogging browser windows, and executing shell commands from Chrome. Our implementation leverages Chrome's built-in features, sideloads malicious components without user interaction, and obfuscates code using WebAssembly to evade detection. This research exposes significant security implications of Chrome's expanding feature set and the challenges of securing modern browsers against abuse.

When: Friday, Aug 8, 11:00 - 11:45 PDT
Where: LVCC West-Level 1-Exhibit Hall 3-Track 5 - Map

Description:
Operational relay box (ORB) networks are used by hackers to obscure their true origin, effectively turning a network of computers into their own private TOR network. This talk is an inside look at a relay network we believe to be based in the Peopleâs Republic of China based entirely on public data we stumbled upon. It will contain an unprecedented level of detail into the specific tools, networks, and development techniques used to create and operate an ORB network.

If youâre a cloud provider trying to stop this type of abuse, a defender trying to understand how to detect when a relay is being used, or a wanna-be attacker, this is the talk for you. We name the cloud providers, data storage systems, software tools, domain names, email addresses, and passwords that they use to create, maintain, and operate their network.

Description:
BOAZ (Bypass, Obfuscate, Adapt, Zero-Trust) evasion was inspired by the concept of multi-layered approach which is the evasive version of defence-in-depth first proposed in a presentation at BH USA14. BOAZ was developed to provide greater control over combinations of evasion methods, enabling more granular evaluations against antivirus and EDR. It is designed to bypass before, during, and post execution detections that span signature, heuristic, and behavioural detection mechanisms. BOAZ supports both x86/x64 binary (PE) or raw payload as input and output EXE or DLL. It has been tested on separated Windows 11 Enterprise, Windows 10, and Windows Server 2022 VMs with 14 desktop AVs and 7 EDRs installed including Windows Defender, Norton, BitDefender, Sophos, and ESET. The design of BOAZ evasion is modular, so users can add their own toolset or techniques to the framework. BOAZ is written in C++ and C and uses Python3 as the main linker to integrate all modules. There have been significant improvements implemented since its inception. The new version of the BOAZ evasion tool, set for release at DEF CON 33, will feature three novel threadless process injection primitives, along with newly implemented loaders and behavioural evasion techniques.

LetâÃÃ´s face it âÃÃ® traditional HTTP C2 is burning out. Between aging domains, TLS cert management, sandbox fingerprinting, and blue teams getting smarter at categorizing traffic and infrastructure, your custom C2 feels less covert and more like a liability. Red teams and threat actors alike are shifting toward living off legitimate services âÃÃ® AWS, GitHub, Box, Notion, whatever blends in âÃÃ® but building solutions that are custom to a single C2 framework? LetâÃÃ´s stop doing that. LetâÃÃ´s share the fun! C4 (Cross-Compatible Command & Control) is here to change that. ItâÃÃ´s a modular toolkit of WASM-powered plugins that makes external C2 easy to implement, regardless of your implant's language or target OS. Whether youâÃÃ´re writing in C, Rust, Go, Python, C#, or something else entirely, C4 plugins can be loaded directly into your implant and run on Windows, macOS, or Linux. But the real game-changer? C4 provides a single, centralized collection of over 10 fully-documented, operationally-ready external C2 modules âÃÃ® not just proof-of-concepts, but production-level integrations with trusted sites that fly under the radar. No more hunting through GitHub repos, hand-rolling fragile API calls, or hacking together glue code for every new environment. Stop reinventing external C2 and start planting some C4 in your implants!

Description:
AGo malware is showing up more often, especially in IoT environments. Its flexibility and ease of cross-compilation make it attractive to attackers, but it also makes life harder for analysts and defenders. Go binaries are large, statically compiled, and structured in ways that traditional tools are not designed to handle. The runtime is unfamiliar, and things like string extraction, function identification, and behavior analysis can quickly become frustrating.  This talk looks at why Go malware is hard to analyze and why some detection tools struggle to keep up. We will walk through practical tips and tools to make reversing Go malware more manageable, including how to recover types, strings, and function information.  To tie everything together, we will look at a recent real-world example: Pumabot, a Go-based botnet targeting IoT surveillance devices. We will dig into how it works, what it targets, and what artifacts it leaves behind. By the end of the session, you will have a better understanding of how attackers are using Go in the wild and how to be better prepared for the next time it shows up in your analysis queue.

Description:
In recent years, ransomware has been one of the most prolific forms of cybercrime with financial gain as primary motive. The problem keeps getting bigger with a new operation seeing the light almost every month. While reverse engineering ransomware is fun, it also serves a greater purpose: can we find a vulnerability that allows us to decrypt a victimâs files without interacting with the criminals? Enter the DoNex ransomware, a new operation that has entered the scene very recently. They have a leak website on the dark web where some victims have been named and shamed. Reverse engineering of a DoNex sample revealed a vulnerability that allowed us to decrypt every encrypted file for victims under a trivial condition. To help victims recover from a ransomware attack, we published a decryption tool on the NoMoreRansom platform, an initiative from a number of parties including the Dutch National Police to keep ransomware operators from extorting victims. In this talk, we will dive into the technical details of DoNex and how we exploited a vulnerability to decrypt files affected by DoNex without the need to negotiate with the cybercriminals.

Description:
The Android virtualization technique allows an app to create independent virtual environments running on top of the Android native one, where multiple apps can be executed simultaneously. While the technique has legitimate uses, attackers have identified ways to exploit it. According to the state-of-art, virtualization-based malware is a significant threat: researchers have found 71,303 malicious samples. Defence mechanisms have already been developed to find virtualization-based malware and to detect or prevent virtualization-based repackaging attacks.In this paper, we offer three key contributions. First, we experimentally evaluate the existing defence mechanisms by identifying their limitations and demonstrating how they can be bypassed. Second, we design and develop a new defence mechanism, called Matrioska, that overcomes the limitations of the state-of-art by detecting the intrinsic features of the virtualization technique. Third, we evaluate the effectiveness of Matrioska with respect to the state-of-art against two datasets of apps. Overall, Matrioska achieves a higher accuracy (99% vs. 71%) when searching for virtualization usage and a lower false positive (10 vs. 23) and false negative rate (14 vs. 39) when detecting a virtualization-based repackaging attack.

Description:
What if learning Nix was like a speed-run?

A few months ago, I'd never touched Nix. Then my friend's brother told me about PlanetNix at Scale22x. I flew from Florida to California with Nix on an old laptop and only four days of flailing experience. I felt grossly under prepared, but after the talks and meeting brilliant people, I was hooked.

Today, I'm building Nix infrastructure full-time and manage every device I own declaratively with tools like Clan.

This talk maps my route from 'what the hell is a derivation?' to contributing to Nix projects in 100 days. I'll share the exact learning path, struggles, and wins. As someone close enough to remember the pain but far enough to have some solutions, I'll crash-course some tough Nix concepts with live demos showing my real usage.

For beginners and the Nix-curious, this can be a great launch point for YOUR speed-run. Nix's learning curve is infamous, but with the right fundamentals and some problem framing, it doesn't have to be.

Description:
The payment fraud landscape is experiencing a resurgence of 'carding' through sophisticated Near Field Communication (NFC) relay attacks, which combine social engineering and custom mobile malware to bypass contactless payment security measures, enabling unauthorized transactions. A critical emerging trend is the proliferation of Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) platforms, primarily operated by Chinese-speaking threat actors, who develop and distribute advanced NFC relay capabilities as turn-key solutions to global affiliates, facilitating complex card-present fraud schemes on an unprecedented scale and leading to arrests in the U.S. and EU. This MaaS operational model, featuring affiliate networks and advanced tools, signifies a critical evolution in financial threats, alarming global financial institutions and necessitating urgent adaptation of fraud prevention strategies. The discussion will explore MaaS operations, presenting key findings from the Supercard X analysis, including its technical capabilities, and examining the implications for the payment industry, with mitigation strategies and actionable intelligence such as actor communications and distinct Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) being shared. Furthermore, the talk will reveal how developers of well-known Android banking trojans are integrating NFC relay functionalities to enhance their cash-out techniques, providing attendees with a deep dive into NFC Relay MaaS, exclusive threat intelligence, and an understanding of the evolving fraud landscape, including the operational models, tools, and TTPs employed by modern NFC Relay MaaS platforms, as well as the systemic risks posed to global financial institutions and the urgent need for adaptive security postures.

Description:
The federal government builds and maintains hundreds of thousands of software systems - and it would be difficult to find a system that doesn't rely on open source software. In fact, the government is likely the single largest consumer of OSS in the world and considering the criticality of the mission, the security of those systems is paramount. There has been limited guidance on how government programs should select, consume, contribute to, and publish open source software, but things are getting better! This session will discuss the current landscape of open source in the federal government and present methods for how we can secure our own systems with tools and processes to vet open source projects, ingest that software securely, and support those projects with substantive contributions.

Attendees from government entities, contractors, and members of the community should attend to learn how the government can tackle the supply chain risks inherent in open source while still capturing the benefits that it has to offer. They'll come away with an understanding of how this might impact their work, and how by working together we can build a better open source ecosystem for everyone.

Description:
Cyberpunk authors, like Neal Stephenson in Snow Crash, have long envisioned a world run by ruthless mega-corporations, with more power than governments, engaging in threat activity. We now live in such a world. Tech companies wield immense, often invisible power, far beyond what they admit to users. Weâve caught glimpses:

â¢ A cloud provider scanning customer data for offensive content
  â¢ A rideshare app tracking users after the ride ends
  â¢ A robotic vacuum that builds maps of your home 
  â¢ A respected security company bricking systems across the globeâ¦ accidentally

These arenât theoretical. Theyâre the tip of the iceberg. The real capabilities, the ones no one talks about, are far more dangerous.

Governments know it. Thatâs why some ban certain apps and hardware.
Threat actors know it. Thatâs why they break in.
The question is: do you know whatâs really possible?

This talk explores the dark potential of modern tech platforms, the things theyâre structurally able to do, whether or not they intend to. Weâll walk through scenarios where companies might be tempted to go offensive, where insiders (or outsiders) could gain and weaponize access, and how these powers could be misused at scale.

Because in security, itâs never about what a system claims to do.
Itâs about what it can do.

Description:
The Digital Markets Act (DMA) is a landmark European law which aims to make digital markets fairer and open. The DMA regulates the behaviour of âgatekeepersâ: large digital players whose closed platforms may limit innovation and choice for users. The DMA sets out âdoâs and donâtsâ, such as enabling interoperability, allowing alternative services (e.g. browsers or app stores), and treating third parties on equal footing. 

In this presentation, you get to hear first-hand from the DMA enforcers about their experience, focusing on the first-ever enforcement action taken under the DMA. In March 2025, the European Commission spelled out how Apple must make iOS and iPadOS work seamlessly with third-party products and services, in particular connected devices such as smartwatches and headphones. We provide insights into how we delivered this concrete change, how the security community played a useful role, and what the benefits will be for developers and users. 

We give a perspective on how the DMA preserves system integrity, security and user privacy when introducing interoperability to a previously closed platform. We also give a broader outlook on what other benefits businesses and end users can expect from the DMA, especially in terms of giving users full control and choice over their devices and data.

SpeakerBio:  Victor Le Pochat, DMA Enforcement Team at European Commission
Victor Le Pochat works in the enforcement team for the Digital Markets Act at the European Commission (DG Connect). Prior to the Commission, he was a postdoctoral researcher working on monitoring the security and privacy of large web ecosystems.

Description:
Imagine discovering critical intelligence hidden inside live video streams faster than any human analyst could. We'll begin with a compelling hypothetical scenario: a breaking news livestream unintentionally captures crucial clues about a missing person's location, but overwhelmed human investigators miss the moment. Inspired by real world challenges investigators face daily, this scenario motivated us to build Autonomous Video Hunter (AVH), a system of AI powered agents that scour video content in real time to extract actionable OSINT.x000D
x000D
Technical core:x000D
We'll showcase how AVH combines open source AI models for image recognition and audio transcription, orchestrated by custom Python based agents. These agents autonomously analyze video streams, detect critical visuals, logos, speech keywords, and quickly cross reference these clues against online databases and OSINT repositories.x000D
x000D
Live demo:x000D
Experience AVH live as it identifies a target logo and relevant context (e.g., social media profiles and geolocation clues) from a random video clip in mere seconds. We'll also address practical challenges, from reducing false positives to scaling efficiently across multiple simultaneous streams.x000D
x000D
By the end of this lightning talk, attendees will understand how autonomous agents transform overwhelming video data into OSINT insights rapidly and effectively. We'll also share a lightweight open source AVH tool for the OSINT community to use and build upon.

Business logic vulnerabilities in APIs are often design oversights that lead to dangerous outcomes. They occur when attackers abuse legitimate API behavior to bypass controls or exploit workflows. In this talk, weâll share field experience developing behavioral analysis techniques that surface exploitable API behaviors at scale. 

We developed a method for passively analyzing API responses - clustering similar logic flows and flagging anomalies that suggest potential abuse paths. Youâll see how business logic vulns manifest in real-world APIs, how attackers chain together valid actions to achieve unintended outcomes, and how defenders can catch these issues early. The session will conclude with practical strategies for integrating business logic awareness into threat modeling and CI/CD pipelines.

Description:
In the spirit of economic development, cities often compete for the attention of large corporate brands, especially ""Big Tech"", to settle in their communities creating attractive incentives like tax-breaks and favorable construction terms. Residents in the affected communities get excited about the prospect of new jobs or career growth. With the recent explosion of the everyday use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) changing work and life as we know it in society, cities want to be known as technology leaders or at least early adopters. And in today's evolving world, one of Cybersecurity's main functions is to not only enable the business but also just as importantly managing risk for the business. As professionals, we have an obligation to ensure that solutions our organizations develop, especially those involving AI, promote benefits to not only the organization but also society and do not cause harm to the environment. In this session, we will explore Cybersecurity's role to understand potential and realized risks of accommodations to secure and implement ""Big Tech"" initiatives in communities with respect to energy, water, and waste systems. Attendees will be exposed to the use of risk management frameworks to identify and mitigate these risks and drive sustainable outcomes as well as the situational applicability of ethics in the cybersecurity profession. Case studies and statistics will be citied from various real-world communities, including black communities. While some case discussed will be resolved with implemented remediations, others will be on-going with the opportunity to explore potential solutions.

Description:
âPublic access - offâ should mean safe, right? Not when a wildcard principal sneaks into Terraform or a quick-start template letting any logged-in account (yours, mine, or a strangerâs) access your sensitive data.

We ran a large-scale, cross-cloud hunt for this quiet misconfiguration, testing it in AWS, Azure and GCP and measuring how often it shows up in real environments. The flaw is sneaky: anonymous requests are getting blocked, yet any authenticated account can still perform actions such as list, get, or even put objects - so a quick browser check tricks you into thinking the bucket is private. Our data shows that more than 15% of cloud environments had at least one bucket publicly exposing sensitive data. As for the remaining 85%, ânot publicâ doesnât always mean private. Further analysis revealed that many of these supposedly restricted buckets still exposed sensitive information unintentionally, including configuration files, code, and AI models.

In this talk weâll outline our scan approach, present the headline numbers and walk through our methodology for detecting risky buckets.

We usually view the world of cybersecurity through the lens of a malicious attacker versus a legitimate actor within a given system. This approach fails when considering the world of data privacy where there are three actors in play: the possibly-benevolent vendor, the legitimate user and the inevitable malicious actor. Using this privacy-focused lens, we survey the current regulatory landscape before turning our attention to how privacy is (not) applied to the automotive world.

Our talk focuses on the unique privacy risks the automotive industry is facing with the advent of smart, connected, cars. We present a real-world case study showing how quickly and thoroughly a bad actor could invade the privacy of a car owner, based on a privacy leak vulnerability designated CVE-2025-26313 (reserved).

Description:
Catastrophic hardware failures. From an aging I/O device to cosmic ray bit flips, memory degradation to CPU fires. When an unrecoverable hardware error is detected, the common platform response is to generate a Machine Check Exception, and shut down before the problem gets worse.

In this talk, we'll see what happens when we circumvent all the traditional fail safes. What happens when, instead of exceptionally rare failures from natural causes, we deliberately create these fatal events from software. When instead of a platform shutdown, we force the system to limp along, damaged but alive. We'll show how carefully injecting these signals during privileged CPU operations can disrupt secure transitions, how those disruptions progress to cascading system failures, and how to ride the chaos to gain hardware privilege escalation. Finally, we'll see how to undo the damage, recover from the unrecoverable, and let the system continue as if nothing happened - now with a foothold in privileged space, all through hardware failure events synthesized through software-only attacks.

We'll conclude by showing how to use this vector to reveal all-new hardware vulnerabilities, and walk through a brave new world of machine check research opportunities - for both attackers and defenders - across technologies and architectures.

Description:
Red teams often struggle with interactive C2 in monitored networks. Low-and-slow channels are stealthy but insufficient for high-bandwidth tasks like SOCKS proxying, pivoting, or hidden VNC. Our research solves this by using real-time collaboration protocolsâspecifically, whitelisted media servers from services like Zoomâto create short-term, high-speed C2 channels that blend into normal enterprise traffic.

We introduce TURNt, an open-source tool that automates covert traffic routing via commonly trusted TURN servers. Since many enterprises whitelist these conferencing IPs and exempt them from TLS inspection, TURNt sessions look just like a legitimate Zoom meeting. Operators can maintain a persistent, stealthy channel while periodically activating higher-bandwidth interactivity for time-sensitive operations.

This talk will show how to set up these âghost calls,â discuss the trade-offs and detection challenges, and explore defensive countermeasures. Attendees will learn how to integrate short-term, real-time C2 into existing red team workflowsâand how to identify and mitigate this emerging threat.

Description:
PyTorch is a machine learning library based on the Torch library, used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing. It is one of the most popular deep learning frameworks.

However, beneath its powerful capabilities lies a potential security risk. Initially, PyTorch used pickle to save models, but due to the insecurity of pickle deserialization, there was a risk of Remote Code Execution (RCE) when loading models. Subsequently, PyTorch introduced the weights_only parameter to enhance security. The official documentation states that weights_only=True is considered safe and recommends using it over weights_only=False.

For years, the security of weights_only=True remained unchallenged. Our research, however, uncovered unsettling truths. We discovered that torch.load with weights_only=True supports TorchScript, leading us to delve into TorchScript's inner workings. After a period of research, we discovered several vulnerabilities and ultimately achieved RCE. We promptly reported this finding to PyTorch, who acknowledged the vulnerability and assigned us CVE-2025-32434. This revelation overturns established understandings and has profound implications for numerous AI applications. We will provide an in-depth analysis of the impact of this vulnerability.

In this sharing, we will introduce how we gained inspiration and discovered this interesting vulnerability. Meanwhile, our findings once again confirm the statement, "The Safe Harbor you once thought was actually Hostile Waters."

Our talk will cover the vulnerabilities we found and journey into the various families of locks made by SecuRam, the OEM of safe locks used by Liberty Safe and other Safe vendors.
Our exploration began with an âanalogâ lock from Liberty Safe but quickly expanded to SecuRamâs âdigitalâ lock lines, where we found a debug port that allowed access to all firmware and data. Through this, we discovered that codes are stored on the externally accessible keypad, rather than securely inside the safe (as well as other issues).
These locks, deployed widely in consumer, and commercial safes at major retail chains exhibit vulnerabilities that enable opening them in seconds with a Raspberry Pi.

Description:
The 2023 loss of the Titan submersible was a tragic wake-up call that exposed dangerous gaps in safety oversight, design practices, and regulation in extreme maritime environments. As leader of the international search-and-rescue response, I witnessed firsthand the human consequences of operating innovative technologies in legal gray zones without sufficient safeguards. Titan's creators leveraged regulatory loopholes to push design boundaries, dismissing expert warnings and bypassing standard safety certifications. This same pattern of unchecked innovation, inadequate oversight, and hubris mirrors critical vulnerabilities now facing maritime cybersecurity. Just as Titanâs passengers unknowingly placed trust in untested designs, vessels today rely increasingly on digitally interconnected yet inadequately secured systems, creating risks that could lead to catastrophic failures. Harsh environmental conditions and remote operations compound the potential impacts of maritime cyber incidents, paralleling Titanâs tragic fate. This paper connects the painful lessons from the Titan tragedy to urgent maritime cybersecurity needsâarguing for clear international regulation, rigorous independent testing, and proactive incident response planningâto prevent similar disasters at sea.

Description:
Imagine one sunny morning you read the news: A crypto worm targets 100+ organizations around the world. The authorities estimate that during the first days of attack ~28,000 hosts in 158 countries were affected, including 24 nation state and European union assets, major banks and tech companies. Since then, the worm has spread and is now everywhere. The industry doesn't know the main source of attack. There are many backdoored artifacts reportedly used by the victims with no obvious connections.

Eventually, a security researcher connects all dots and finds the source: compromised, abandoned AWS S3 buckets. The risk that researchers warned in the past materialized on a truly gigantic scale, 5155 buckets were affected.

Luckily, this incident has never happened. The buckets used in that hypothetical scenario were claimed by a security researcher and taken down by the Cloud provider. 

In this talk, we will dissect the anatomy of such an attack. We will show that adversaries equipped with instruments of big data analysis and custom LLM-agents can take these scenarios to the next level by automating and scaling them. We will share statistical insights and 9 concrete stories illustrating potential victim profiles and attack vectors. Finally, we will discuss remediation actions that would eliminate the risk once and for all.

Description:
Copycat is a browser extension-based red team toolkit for simulating web-based identity attacks. This tool simulates ten web-based identity attacks through a single browser extension with minimal permissions, operating primarily through hidden windows that execute attacks without user awareness. With Copycat, red teams can simulate complex attack scenarios including silent Gmail and LinkedIn hijacking, credential theft through login and OTP stealing, login page redirection, autofill extraction from enterprise applications, and multiple OAuth manipulation techniques. Copycat runs entirely in-browser with no special hardware requirements. Red teams can use Copycat to demonstrate attack vectors that bypass EDRs, SASE, and other traditional security controls, as these techniques operate within legitimate authenticated sessions rather than breaking them. The tool is fully modifiable, with each module designed for customization to target different services or authentication flows. Source code and documentation will be available for security researchers to extend and improve the framework. Special mention to Pankaj Sharma, Tejeswara S. Reddy, and Arpit Gupta for their contributions in building this toolkit!

Description:
Latin America has a distinct cyber threat landscape, presenting a fragmented and heterogeneous IT infrastructure with often outdated systems, limited cyber maturity, and budget constraints converge, making it an ideal playground for cyberattacks.x000D
x000D
While ransomware is a global concern, in LATAM, threat actors enjoy extended dwell times, silently navigating networks, studying victim environments, and maximizing damage before encryption is deployed. This not only increases the success rate of the attacks but also enables operators to maintain persistence or monetize access by reselling it. The monetization of unauthorized access has become a growing market in Latin America, often just as profitable as ransomware deployment itself.x000D
x000D
The ransomware ecosystem has expanded significantly with business models like Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS). From Latin America, a region where the primary motivation for cyberattacks is financial, it's possible to see a different perspective on this ecosystem.x000D
x000D
This talk dives deep into the evolving ransomware threat landscape across LATAM, where attackers benefit from its unique landscape. We'll explore the TTPs of the most active ransomware families in the region,  RaaS operations, prolonged Intrusions, and regional adaptations. Through technical analysis and regional case studies, weâll highlight how ransomware operators are adapting to exploit legacy infrastructure, regional geopolitics, and socioeconomic realities.x000D
x000D
The topics covered will include:x000D
*Brief overview of the LATAM ransomware threat landscape.x000D
*Most active ransomware and RaaS families targeting LATAM, interesting and relevant case studies.x000D
*Analysis of common TTPs and attacker behavior in LATAM ransomware intrusions.x000D
*Socio Economic and geopolitical factors that influence attacker operations in the region.x000D
*Monetization strategies beyond encryption: access resale, data exfiltration, and extortion trends.

Description:
This talk presents a deep dive into a real-world case where KeePass â a widely trusted open-source password manager â was weaponized and used as part of a malware delivery campaign. The attackers distributed a trojanized version of KeePass through Bing malicious advertisements, leveraging fake download pages to lure unsuspecting victims searching for the software. The modified binary retained full KeePass functionality, making it nearly indistinguishable from the legitimate version. Behind the scenes, it acted as a stealthy loader, ultimately deploying a Cobalt Strike BEACON to establish persistent access.

Description:
Banking Trojans targeting Windows systems have been affecting users in Latin America for many years, with their peculiarities in the tactics, techniques and procedures used by the criminals responsible for their development. However, it was not until the early 2020s that massive campaigns began to be detected with targets outside their usual region of operation, with special emphasis on Spain and Portugal. Since then, these campaigns have not ceased and several malware families have evolved to try to be more effective, with several different criminal groups collaborating in several of these campaigns and sharing their infrastructure. Through all this years many researchers at both sides of the Atlantic ocean have worked together to gather intel that could help to take down these cybercriminal organizations with some important achievements. The goal for this presentation is to analyze the reasons why the criminals behind these threats have been successful despite the increase in online banking security measures, while revealing the latest results obtained after analyzing the most recent campaigns of these threats. We will provide several examples of campaigns used by these malware families and how they are trying to adapt to keep being successful in obtaining new victims.

Where: LVCC West-Level 1-Exhibit Hall 1-405 (Red Team Village)-RTV Tactics 1 - Map

Description:
AIMAL (Artificially Intelligent Malware Launcher) is a modular red team framework built to simulate advanced malware evasion techniques against modern AV/EDR/IDS solutions. It supports Process Herpaderping, Process Hollowing, Thread Hijacking, Process Ghosting, and many other Evasion Techniques as delivery mechanisms, with stealth enhancements including PPID 
spoofing, shellcode polymorphism, syscall mutation (Hellâs Gate), and aggressive AMSI/ETW bypassing. AIMAL adapts to simulated detection responses through a feedback loop that mutates behavior on the fly â rotating techniques until the payload bypasses detection. Integration with the OpenAI API allows AIMAL to suggest the best evasion strategy based on alert context, helping simulate the decision-making process of advanced threat actors. Designed for research, red teaming, and adversarial simulation, AIMAL brings real-world stealth techniques  into an intelligent feedback-driven system that learns and adapts like an evolving threat. Whether used for red team drills or research into next-gen evasion, AIMaL demonstrates how AI can weaponize malware beyond static signatures and into dynamic decision-making.

This process is not just about executing code â itâs about demonstrating how 
real malware adapts. The user is taken through a full offensive simulation 
workflow:
 1. AIMAL prints a stylized menu with ET options.
 2.The user selects an evasion technique (e.g., Process Herpaderping).
 3. The user selects a payload (e.g., reverse shell).
 4. AIMAL copies and prepares the full module structure (not just EXEs).
 5. The user simulates a detection alert type and string.
 6. AIMAL uses OpenAI to suggest a bypass strategy.
 7. The user can authorize AIMAL to automatically:Addjunkfunctions (hash evasion), Inject stealth upgrades (e.g., call RandomNoise(), add extra PolymorphShellcodeAfter()), Apply PPID spoofing or syscall mutations, Rebuild, mutate and repack the payload.

AIMAL has already demonstrated success against multiple AVs. Using static 
stealth alone, it bypassed both signature and behavioral detection of Windows 
Defender and McAfee. Bitdefender and Kaspersky were bypassed on static 
signatures; after OpenAI integration, AIMAL also defeated their behavioral 
detection.

Description:
We have exposed critical offensive capabilities in the azbridge tool, which has been available in Microsoft Azure's GitHub repository since 2018. This tool is a legitimate utility connecting network-isolated assets. Our research demonstrates how an attacker can weaponize this tool using its default configuration.

azbridge supports attackers in establishing covert C2 channels, exfiltrating data, and enabling lateral movement while evading scrutiny by perimeter defenses. It leverages back-end services that serve Azure Relay endpoints (*.servicebus.windows.net) and encapsulates malicious traffic in TLS-encrypted connections to *.cloudapp.azure.com endpoints, defeating egress filtering and proxy inspection.

We demonstrate how attackers can use it to maintain persistent network access, bypass network security controls, and conduct post-exploitation using Microsoft's tool. More sophisticated adversaries can re-implement the functionality of this tool in their tradecraft (e.g., implants). For our defensive side friends, we provide initial recommendations on recognizing these techniques to defend against adversaries exploiting legitimate infrastructure.

While not a 0-day, as of 03/14/2025, there are no reports of adversaries using azbridge, and no researchers have reported this toolâs potential for abuse. Therefore, we believe it is a novel use case or at least one that has not been publicly discussed.

Tags: Red Team Village | Creator Workshop
When: Friday, Aug 8, 12:00 - 12:50 PDT
Where: LVCC West-Level 1-Exhibit Hall 1-405 (Red Team Village)-RTV Track 2 - Map

Description:
While there is increasing content on attacking LLMs hitting the Internet (and at DEFCON), much of it is focused on attacking LLMs from more of a penetration-test perspective without putting the attacks into the broader context of a Red Team operation. As with any technology that we encounter in a network during a Red Team exercise, we should be familiar with how to use it to achieve goals like lateral movement or privilege escalation. Like it or not, in the near future that will increasingly include LLM-based applications and agents.

This session aims to close that gap. The speakers will start with some entry-level theory on how LLMs function under the hood. No math experience? No problem. We're going to keep things at a nice, high level with special focus on the core functionality of LLMs that enables attacks.

After addressing the theory, the speakers will shift to real-world attacks on LLMs drawn from our operations. This will take two forms: strategies to break LLMs through direct and indirect prompt injection, and ways to take a successful prompt injection and turn it into progress toward your Red Team objectives like enumeration, lateral movement, privilege escalation, or execution.

With the groundwork laid, the workshop will close with a hands-on, multi-level CTF for participants to try some of the direct and indirect prompt injection strategies discussed in the workshop.

Detailed Agenda:
1. Introductions (2 mins)
2. Theory: 
    a. Neural Networks (10 mins)
    b. LLMs (10 mins)
3. Attack Strategies (15 mins)
    a. Direct prompt injection strategies + war stories
    b. Indirect prompt injection strategies + war stories
4. Hands-on CTF (20 mins)
5. Q&A (remainder)

Description:
NOTE: There is an accompanying tactic that goes along with this workshop which will begin after the workshop completes.

This session explores advanced security mechanisms implemented by major browsers to prevent cookie theft from their storage databases. Chrome has recently implemented AppBound encryption, which provides multi-layered protection for session cookies:

1) A 2-way DPAPI encryption system that operates with both elevated NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM permissions and normal user-level decryption capabilities;

2) A state-key encryption layer utilizing the ChaCha20Poly1305 algorithm with custom keys (that once was AES-256-GCM encrypted);

These implementations have significantly reduced the effectiveness of info-stealing malware. However, this session will demonstrate potential vulnerabilities in these security measures and explain how to obtain decrypted cookies despite these protections. We will examine the new format specifications and encryption methodologies for cookies.

Beyond Chromium-based browsers, we'll explore Gecko's encryption algorithms, which involve structured ASN.1 data formats with multiple encryption schemes including 3DES and AES-256. We'll also analyze Chromium on macOS which relies on PBKDF2 key derivation, and WebKit-based browsers that store cookies in binary cookie files.

Additionally, we'll discuss Chrome's forthcoming "Device Bound Session Cookies" (DBSC) technology, which aims to further mitigate session hijacking through cookie theft by implementing TPM chip-based encryption and requiring proof of possession of the cryptographic key.

Description:
SeVa aims to provide an accurate triage and priority framework for secrets with below philosophy:
1) Secrets which are confirmed to be valid will be of most priority
2) Secrets which are confirmed to be not valid will be of least priority
3) Remaining secrets will have severity as per triage

SeVa has three primary independent modules:
1) Connector - To connect with a secret source and fetch the details, support major secret scanners
2) Enhancer - This module identifies the secret type and what additional information is required to make a decision on validation as defined above. It also fetches the complimentary information from affected area
3) Validator - This engine validates the secrets and makes the decision on secret validity and provides the output in multiple formats

SeVA provides a fast and noninvasive way to verify credentials with non-intrusive API calls without secrets leaving organization infrastructure. It can be adopted as easily as writing a GitHub Action workflow.

Description:
Not every team has a security budget. Not every project has a dedicated AppSec engineer. But every product exposed to the internet needs some level of security to survive.

This talk explores what I call âThe AppSec Poverty Lineâ also known as âMinimal Viable Securityâ â the minimum viable set of practices, tools, and cultural shifts that under-resourced dev teams can adopt to meaningfully improve application security. Whether you're a startup with no security hires, an independent dev, or part of a team that doesnât have a security budget, this talk will help you prioritize what actually matters.

Weâll cover practical approaches to getting from zero to secure-ish, with a focus on:
    â¢   Training developers to write more secure code, and spot unsafe code
    â¢   Cultivating a security-positive culture
    â¢   Leveraging open-source tools that punch above their weight
    â¢   Knowing when âgood enoughâ really is enough â and when itâs not

* Where are you investing right now to detect and block with nation state adversariesâ whatâs working and what hyped methods are a waste of time?
* Speaking of cliches, too many alerts, not enough people and timeâ yes, we need to tune, but what are we doing to win here?  Is it sustainable?  Should we give up on conventional detection?
* Letâs talk about generative AIâ where are you seeing SOC actually use it, and where do you think weâre still a ways off?

Description:
In this engaging talk, we will embark on a journey through the trials and triumphs of constructing a 100% serverless, scalable security platform. Starting about 2 years ago when we bootstrapped Jit, we will share all the lessons we have learned along the way to build our platform - both in terms of people and technology.Â 

As we venture into the land of serverless architecture, we will discuss its power but also confront the myth that less hardware equates to fewer headaches. Spoiler alert: it doesn't, but the lessons learned are invaluable. Takeaways: Serverless has become an excellent way to ramp up infrastructure operations for cloud first companies. However, this comes with its own set of security challenges, including the popular OWASP Top 10. In this talk, we will dive into what it takes to build a real world secure and scalable serverless platform for your engineering.

Abstract:
==========
Google Cloudâs Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) is often seen as the final gatekeeper for internal GCP services - but what happens when that gate quietly swings open? This session uncovers how subtle misconfigurations in IAP can lead to serious data exposure, even in environments with no public IPs, strict VPC Service Controls, and hardened perimeters. Weâll introduce a new vulnerability in IAP that enables data exfiltration, allowing attackers to bypass traditional network controls entirely, without ever sending traffic to the public internet. In addition, weâll walk through real-world examples of overly permissive IAM bindings, misplaced trust in user-supplied headers, and overlooked endpoints that quietly expand the attack surface. Attendees will gain a deeper understanding of IAPâs internal workings, practical detection strategies, and a critical perspective on trust boundaries in GCP.

Description:

This talk delivers a technical dive into Google Cloudâs IAP, a service widely used to enforce access controls on internal applications - and often assumed to be foolproof. We begin with a concise overview of how IAP works behind the scenes, including its identity enforcement model and how it integrates with IAM and backend services.

The core focus is on teaching defenders how these misconfigurations manifest in logs once an attacker begins to exploit them, equipping them to build effective detections and stop breaches before they escalate. Whether itâs during the initial configuration tampering or while actively bypassing controls, Iâll walk through what those activities actually look like in GCP logs. For each misconfiguration, Iâll present real log snippets, unpack the most revealing details, and show how to correlate signals, even those outside of IAP-specific logs, to detect and investigate IAP abuse effectively.

The highlight of the session is a new research technique we've developed: exploiting IAP's CORS behavior to exfiltrate sensitive data using preflight OPTIONS requests, effectively bypassing traditional network egress controls. This method can succeed even in highly restricted environments with no internet access, no public IPs, and VPC Service Controls fully enforced. The issue has been responsibly disclosed to Google and is currently under review, with an expected review timeline of 30 days.

Weâre sharing this research to highlight just how fragile IAP configurations can be, where even a minor misstep or overlooked setting can unintentionally expose internal resources to the internet. Alongside the technique, weâll provide practical detection strategies to help defenders identify this specific attack vector through GCPâs logging infrastructure.

Weâll wrap up with detection strategies using GCP logs to identify abuse patterns, surface subtle signs of exploitation, and improve monitoring around one of GCPâs most sensitive gateways.

Description:
As cloud infrastructure becomes a prime target for adversaries, defenders must evolve their detection capabilities to stay ahead. Join us for an immersive, hands-on workshop where weâll emulate real-world attacker behaviours and build compelling detection logic using Azure-native logs and tools.

This workshop introduces participants to Azure's control and data plane logging systems, the visibility gaps in API-based detection, and how Microsoft Sentinel can be leveraged for threat detection using KQL. Participants will first explore the landscape of Azure telemetry, including log tables like AzureActivity, AuditLogs, SigninLogs, and MicrosoftGraphAPI, to understand whatâs availableâand whatâs missingâwhen trying to detect threats in the cloud.

The core of the session is focused on executing and detecting high-impact TTPs such as:

Unauthorised use of Azure CLI

Run Command Abuse on virtual machines

Mass blob reads and deletions

Malicious Key Vault access attempts

Through guided simulations, attendees will perform these actions in a dedicated Azure tenant, then pivot to the defender side to query relevant logs using Kusto Query Language (KQL), surfacing anomalies, and crafting detections.

Whether you're a cloud defender, threat hunter, or detection engineer, this session offers a rare opportunity to simulate adversary behaviour and refine detection strategies in a realistic Azure environment. By the end of this workshop, youâll leave with practical KQL queries, detection playbooks, and hands-on experience in defending cloud infrastructure against modern threats.

Tenant Deployment Instructions:

Each participant will receive access to a pre-provisioned Azure tenant with the necessary services (including virtual machines, storage accounts, Key Vaults, function apps, and AKS clusters) already deployed and configured. Diagnostic settings will be pre-enabled to stream control and data plane logs into Microsoft Sentinel for immediate use.

Furthermore, all participants will deploy their Azure tenants through the TryHackMe platform, where credentials will be automatically provisioned. This streamlined setup ensures secure, consistent access for all attendees. Additional browser-based consoles will be provided directly within the TryHackMe environment to support hands-on activities, eliminating the need for local installation.

Description:
In 2023, Microsoft detected a nation state actor (Forest Blizzard/STRONTIUM) exploiting a "zero-click" remote code execution vulnerability in Outlook by sending a malicious email. Microsoft fixed this in part by adding a call to the MapUrlToZone API, which determines where a path is located so callers can make a trust decision. Critical components like Outlook, Office, Windows Shell and sandboxes rely on MapUrlToZone to make intelligent security decisions, but little research has historically focused on MapUrlToZone itself. Microsoft Security Response Center has a unique role in analyzing systemic trends in areas like this and drive deep technical research to remediate security issues. 
This talk will focus on MSRC's review of the MapUrlToZone API which identified several novel ways to trick Windows into thinking that a remote untrusted file exists on the local machine.  We will talk about how we approached this research and exploited key differences in how MapUrlToZone and the Windows filesystem parse file paths.
In total, this research identified a dozen CVEs across various vulnerability types. All of the issues covered have been fixed with CVEs in early 2025. In addition to the individual fixes for this component, we'll also cover how MSRC worked with internal teams to build more comprehensive mitigations.

Description:
Is there a security boundary between Active Directory and Entra ID in a hybrid environment? The answer to this question, while still somewhat unclear, has changed over the past few years as there has been more hardening of how much âthe cloudâ trusts data from on-premises. The reason for this is that many threat actors, including APTs, have been making use of known lateral movement techniques to compromise the cloud. In this talk, we take a deep dive together into Entra ID and hybrid trust internals. We will introduce several new lateral movement techniques that allow us to bypass authentication, MFA and stealthily exfiltrate data using on-premises AD as a starting point, even in environments where the classical techniques donât work. All these techniques are new, not really vulnerabilities, but part of the design. Several of them have been remediated with recent hardening efforts by Microsoft. Very few of them leave useful logs behind when abused. As you would expect, none of these âfeaturesâ are documented. Join me for a wild ride into Entra ID internals, undocumented authentication flows and tenant compromise from on-premises AD.

Description:
The LaunchAnywhere vulnerability has long been a significant concern in Android security, allowing unprivileged applications to invoke protected activities, even with system-level privileges, and have been actively exploited in the wild in the past.

In response, Google and device vendors have implemented patches, primarily by introducing destination component checks within privileged code before launching Intents. These fixes appeared to have mitigated such risksâat least on the surface. But has the threat truly been eliminated?

In this session, we demonstrate that these defenses remain insufficient. We introduce a new exploitation technique, BadResolve, which bypasses these checks through multiple methods, enabling a zero-permission app to achieve LaunchAnywhere once again. We reveal high-severity vulnerabilities that affect all Android versions, including the latest Android 16 (at time of writing), which have been confirmed and patched by Google. Dead, made alive againâ we show how the LaunchAnywhere vulnerability has been reborn. In addition to presenting new exploitation techniques, we tackle the challenge of efficiently and accurately identifying methods in the vast codebases of AOSP and vendor-specific closed-source implementations that could be exploited by BadResolve, using LLM Agents and MCP.

Description:
Have I Been Ransomed? is a specialized security service, akin to Have I Been Pwned, designed to detect personal data exposure specifically from ransomware leaks. As ransomware attacks increasingly involve data theft and public dumping, individuals need a way to check if their personally identifiable information has been compromised. Our platform goes beyond standard database checks by processing a wide array of leaked file types, including PDFs, documents, and text files. We employ advanced optical character recognition coupled with sophisticated large language models to meticulously scan unstructured data and extract sensitive identifiers such as national ID cards, driverâÃÃ´s licenses, and social security numbers. Have I Been Ransomed? provides critical awareness, empowering users to discover if their sensitive information has been exposed in a ransomware incident and enabling them to take proactive steps against potential identity theft and fraud.

Description:
Any chip of sufficient complexity needs one thing if they want to actually get used in devices - a Software Development Kit (SDK). This collection of binaries, proprietary services, and code samples allows board designers to quickly and easily incorporate an otherwise complex chip into their existing environments. However, once this code is bundled into various product lines from various vendors, it becomes nearly impossible to make sure it gets updated with new versions. What happens if a vulnerability is discovered? Suddenly, hundreds of thousands of devices all from different vendors spanning years of releases are all affected by the same bug and it turns into a perpetual game of whack-a-mole trying to get them all patched. And botnet authors are definitely paying attention. In this talk, we will discuss the attack surfaces present in the SDKs from some major chipset manufacturers, talk about some exploits (both old-day and 0-day), and try to figure out what can be done to cleanse the internet of the zombie SDK vuln plague.

Finch is a lightweight reverse proxy that makes allow, block, or route decisions based on TLS and HTTP fingerprints (JA3, JA4, JA4H, and HTTP/2), before traffic reaches your production servers or research honeypots. Layered on top, a custom AI agent monitors Finchâs event stream, silences boring bots, auto-updates rules, and even crafts stub responses for unhandled paths; so the next probing request gets a convincing reply. The result is a self-evolving, fingerprint-aware firewall that slashes bot noise and turns passive traps into dynamic deception.

Description:
When Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, scholars and archivists were concerned that if the web presence of Ukraine's cultural heritage institutions (libraries, archives, museums, and other community organizations) fell into Russian hands, Putin's vision for rewriting Ukrainian history could become reality. Saving Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Online (SUCHO) started as a rapid-response data rescue effort to archive these websites in a distributed way to ensure no single point of failure could delay the project working around the clock. Access was a priority in choosing a tool suite, to accommodate a volunteer pool that expanded to include elders and children. This talk reflects on the several threads of access that SUCHO has focused on, including managing security/privacy concerns, getting physical hardware to organizations in a war zone, providing a platform for publishing newly digitized material, and preserving/annotating the ephemeral cultural heritage of war memes. Since January 2025, the hypothetical concerns that drove SUCHO have become a reality in the context of US government websites and datasets. The talk concludes with lessons learned over the course of SUCHO that shape the work that SUCHO "alumni" are currently doing to ensure ongoing access to at-risk data in the US.

SpeakerBio:  Quinn Dombrowski
Quinn Dombrowski is one of the co-founders of Saving Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Online (SUCHO), and an Academic Technology Specialist in Stanford's Division of Literatures, Cultures, and Languages, and in Stanford Libraries. Given a computer lab to manage in 2018, Quinn got rid of the ancient computers, bought some sewing machines, and put up a sign calling it the Textile Makerspace. Then people started to believe it, and fund it, and now Quinn teaches Data Visualization with Textiles there every spring and manages a space full of sewing machines, looms, crochet hooks, and multiple hacked digital knitting machines. Quinn has served as co-president of the Association for Computers and the Humanities (the US-based organization for Digital Humanities), and founded The Data-Sitters Club, a project that walks through, step-by-step, how to use different computational tools and methods for literature. They have incorporated textile data encoding into their work in various forms, including weaving all the data (grading, attendance, readings, complaint emails) from an AI class they taught, knitting all regularly-scheduled meetings and when they were canceled in 2022, and visualizing the distribution of references to computers, librarians, and archives across "Star Trek" novels.

Description:
What if you bypass SSIDs, association handshakes, IP, and every "normal" layer of Wi-Fi, and just sling raw 802.11 frames? With Scapy and two USB WiFi adapters, I'll demonstrate four bite-sized hacks that treat Wi-Fi as a blank RF pipe. No access point required.

Raw 802.11 File Drop: A wink to the fruit company's file-beam trick. Hurl a PDF into the airwaves and catch it on a friend's laptop. No pairing or IP required.

Walkie-talkie: Embed a PCM audio stream in raw broadcast frames. No association needed.

Meshtastic-over-Wi-Fi: Repackage the popular LoRa mesh-chat protocol into 802.11 frames for hop-to-hop messaging at Wi-Fi speeds.

WiFiFS: A FUSE filesystem mapping RF traffic to files. You can cat, cp, or grep packets as they fly by.

Each script is short enough to skim while your espresso shot pulls, light on dependencies, and leaves ordinary clients blissfully unaware of the mischief on channel 6. You'll walk away with working code, a new mental model of 802.11 as raw clay, and plenty of inspiration to craft your own oddball protocols. No access points, just DIY frame-level fun.

Description:
This presentation will detail the design and implementation of a Meshtastic-based command and control infrastructure. By leveraging the Meshtastic network for out-of-band communications, operators can achieve secure, decentralized monitoring and management of Linux hosts in hard-to-reach environments. Whether supporting a remote dropbox deployment or a distant ham shack, this solution enables encrypted shell access and configuration changes using a low-cost ($25) LoRa radio over extended ranges. Although not intended for high-bandwidth tasks, it provides an efficient platform for debugging, troubleshooting, and command execution in constrained network conditions. Furthermore, by utilizing the existing Meshtastic mesh, users can often avoid the complexity of building a dedicated network.

Description:
Kubernetes is the de facto operating system of the cloud, and more and more organizations are running their workloads on Kubernetes. While Kubernetes offers many benefits, it also introduces new security risks, such as cluster misconfiguration, leaked credentials, cryptojacking, container escapes, and vulnerable clusters.

In this workshop, attendees will learn how to attack Kubernetes clusters by simulating a real-world adversary exploiting one of the most recent vulnerabilities in the ecosystem: IngressNightmare (CVE-2025-1974). Participants will practice exfiltrating service account tokens and credentials, performing lateral movement, escalating privileges by targeting common applications deployed in Kubernetes environments, and ultimately compromising the entire cluster.

The Ham Radio Village is excited to return to DEF CON 33, offering you the opportunity "Access Everything" by gaining you access to the airwaves though free amateur radio license exams! Ham radio has a long history with ham radio operators being considered the original electronic hackers, innovating long before computers, integrated circuits, or even transistors were invented. The Ham Radio Village keeps this spirit alive by providing free ham radio license exams at DEF CON.

In today's world, wireless communication is essential. A fundamental understanding of radio technology is more important than ever. Earning your amateur radio license opens the door to the world of amateur radio, providing you with valuable knowledge of radio frequency (RF) technology. This knowledge can be applied to a wide range of other RF-related topics, including RFID credentials, Wi-Fi, and other wireless communication systems.

Registration is required and can be completed anytime before taking the exam.

Exams are drop-in and you can show up ant anytime during the testing window until 45 minutes before the end of the exam session (to allow ample time for testing, grading, and paperwork).

Description:
This presentation will describe the history and significance of the California Top to Bottom Review (TTBR), the landmark study of voting systems whose report disclosed many serious security vulnerabilities in the systems used in California and led to changes in the systems certified for use in that state. The talk will also cover that studyâs lesser-known but equally important cousin, the Post Election Audit standards Working Group, whose report gave rise to the fundamental concept of risk limiting audits (RLAs).

SpeakerBio:  Debra Bowen, The Honorable
Debra Bowen was the elected Secretary of State of California for two terms from 2007 to 2015. Prior to that, from 1992 to 2006, she had been a member of the California Assembly and then the Senate.  In 2007, at the beginning of her term as Secretary of State, she commissioned the Top to Bottom Review (TTBR) of voting systems used in California. The review involved top computer security researchers, attorneys, and accessibility experts, and provided the nation with an unprecedented view into the state of voting machines. The TTBR led to critical changes to improve Californiaâs elections and influenced other states to move away from the most insecure voting systems. In parallel she commissioned the Post Election Audit Standards Working Group (PEASWG), a group of experts charged with outlining standards for election auditing. From their report emerged the very first formal description of what came to be known as risk-limiting audits (RLAs), now widely viewed as the âgold standardâ of auditing techniques. RLAs make the notions of evidence-based elections and software independence, two of the fundamental pillars of election integrity, an achievable goal.For her âbold leadership and her steadfast resolve to protect the integrity of the voteâ she was honored with a 2008 Profile in Courage Award by the John F. Kennedy Presidential  Library and Museum.

Incident response often feels like drowning in a sea of logs. While LLMs promise a lifeline, simply dropping a chatbot into a DFIR tool is not enough.

This talk pivots from "Can AI analyze logs?" to "How do we build a trustworthy, human-centric AI partner for investigators?" We present our journey integrating a Sec-Gemini Log Reasoning Agent into Timesketch, the open-source forensic timeline analysis platform. Our core focus will be how we built the Log Reasoning Agent and the UX research required to make AI findings verifiable and actionable.

We will deconstruct our design philosophy, which reimagines the analyst's workflow around AI-generated insights and investigative questions. We'll explore the specific UI/UX patterns we developed to empower analysts to seamlessly trace AI conclusions back to the source evidence, fostering a "trust but verify" mindset essential for high-stakes investigations. Attendees will leave with a new framework for thinking about AI in security operationsâone that prioritizes human-computer interaction over black-box automation.

BIC works hard to give more bad days to bad actors. Luckily, threat actors move to a certain rhythm, and following it can be just what you need to give them more blues. This session will demonstrate Domain Intelligence Analysis, a newly discussed concept from our investigations team that equips the audience to efficiently use DNS artifacts to protect their organization. Whether preventing a potential threat or responding to an existing one, DNS can support specific actions that make achieving these goals easier.

Domain Intelligence Analysis informs incident response efforts and can shape detection engineering to identify and investigate threats earlierâwhen context is more valuable. These techniques will be supported with examples of domain and infrastructure discoveries made by our research team, some of which were featured in the 2025 Trends in Malicious Infrastructure report, created with support from two Black practitioners. These examples show how quickly domains can be discovered before they become public IOCs.

Join this presentation to identify relevant IOCs faster and enable more informed, timely investigations into cybercrime.

Description:
Last year, both of us (Eliraz and Alon) participated DEF CON, and the Cloud Village was our favorite. One of the topics that was well covered in last's year conference was the threat of Azure Managed Identities abuse. While many offensive aspects related to it were covered as part of DEFCON, and different articles and talks over the past year, the defensive aspects of it remained uncovered.
This year we want to visit the cloud village again, this time sharing our research of the last 4 months, in which we will fill in this significant defensive gap to complement last year's talks, by focusing on proactive threat-hunting techniques to identify and address Azure MI abuse. By examining common attack vectors and presenting advanced detection strategies, we aim to bridge the visibility gap and equip security teams with practical tools for forensic investigation and real-time monitoring using diverse Microsoft log sources. 

We aim to empower participants with advanced strategies for leveraging Microsoft log sources, providing practical knowledge and detailed examples that span both real-time monitoring and forensic investigation. This talk is grounded in comprehensive research weâve conducted over the past few months, during which we simulated various MI abuse scenarios and analyzed relevant logs and detection opportunities across dozens of enterprise environments.
Weâve already released the first 2 parts of our research series, the first part in which we explore the blast radius of a compromised Managed Identity and the significance of NHIs (Non-Human Identities) in the broader cloud threat landscape, and the second one in which we covered threat hunting, investigation techniques, and forensic analysis of such incidents. In this talk, we will cover this and more!
Attendees will leave this session equipped with key takeaways that will help them immediately recognize and respond to incidents involving compromised Managed Identities. Theyâll learn how to quickly determine if an MI was involved, assess its blast radius, correlate activity across five or more Azure log sources, and use Azure-specific forensic artifacts to speed up containment and remediation.
And this isnât just for incident response teams - SOC analysts and detection engineers will gain tools and techniques for building targeted detections that bring MI-based threats into visibility. Offensive security professionals will benefit too, gaining a clearer understanding of how MIs can be abused to move laterally across Azure subscriptions, Entra ID, Microsoft 365, and even hybrid environments.

Description:
Apple Intelligence, Appleâs newest AI product, is designed to enhance productivity with AI while maintaining Apple's focus on user experience and privacy, often highlighting its use of localized models as a key advantage. But how well do these assurances hold up under scrutiny? While Apple emphasizes privacy as a core principle, my findings challenge some of these claims, illustrating the importance of scrutinizing AI-driven assistants before widespread adoption.

In this talk, we take a closer look at the data flows within Apple Intelligence, examining how it interacts with user data and the potential security and privacy risks that come with it. Using traffic analysis and OS inspection techniques, we explore what information is accessed, how it moves through the system, and where it gets transmitted. Our findings challenge common security assumptions of Apple, revealing unexpected behaviors and data leaks. From encrypted traffic to data leakage concerns, this presentation will provide practical insights for users and security professionals alike.

Description:
Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices are indispensable in many corporate and home environments. These devices often live on the network edge, providing convenient remote access to confidential files and internal networks from the public internet. What happens when this goes terribly wrong?

In this presentation, Iâll discuss how I developed a zero-day exploit targeting dozens of Synology NAS products. At the time of discovery, the exploit facilitated unauthenticated root-level remote code execution on millions of NAS devices in the default configuration. My exploitation strategy centered around smuggling different types of delimiters that targeted multiple software components.

In the past, exploitation of the vulnerabilityâs bug class demanded additional primitives that werenât available on my targets. While searching for alternative paths, I discovered a novel remote Linux exploitation technique. Iâll be presenting this technique, which can be used in other researchersâ exploit chains in the future. For the first time in public, Iâll also be discussing the details of my Synology vulnerability research, which won a $40,000 prize at the October 2024 Pwn2Own competition.

Description:
The RPC protocol allows executing functions on remote servers. An interface is identified by a UUID, and clients contact specific RPC endpoints to communicate with it. Some endpoints may be well-known to clients, but some are provided through the EPM (Endpoint Mapper). These are called Dynamic Endpoints.

As servers request to map UUIDs to their Dynamic Endpoints, we wondered what stops us from mapping a UUID of a trusted RPC interface to an endpoint that we control, leading to our own malicious RPC interface.

We discovered that nothing stops unprivileged users from imposing as a well-known RPC server! However, to have clients connect to us, we needed to register first. We, as the underdog racer, need to beat services in their home race track.

We examined the status of RPC servers at certain points during boot and mapped several interfaces we can abuse. We then took a shot racing their services and won the gold medal! Various high integrity processes and some even PPLs trusted us to be their RPC server!

In this talk, weâll present âRPC-Racerâ - a toolset for finding insecure RPC services and winning the race against them! Weâll show it manipulating a PPL process to authenticate the machine account against any server we want! Finally, weâll describe how to validate the integrity of RPC servers, to mitigate this issue.

Apple champions user privacy and security, but beneath its glossy screens and polished interfaces lies an overlooked field of subtle vulnerabilities lurking within trusted, everyday features: Siri, Spotlight, Safari, Apple Intelligence, and Apple's official support systems. This talk dives deeply into multiple zero-day issues discovered on fully updated, non-jailbroken iPhonesâno specialized tools required. I'll demonstrate how missing lock-state checks, Siri context confusion, race conditions, faulty Unicode parsing, incomplete patches, and other subtle oversights enabled me to bypass Face ID locks, retrieve sensitive user data, spoof emails, and trigger daemon crashes. Specifically, I'll show you how I disclosed sensitive data on locked devices via Siri (CVE-2025-24198) and Spotlight (CVE-2024-44235), bypassed Safari's Face ID protection on private tabs (CVE-2025-30468), executed deceptive email spoofing (CVE-2025-24225), leaked Apple Intelligence internal prompts and Private Cloud Compute data to ChatGPT, and exploited an unresolved IDOR vulnerability on Apple's support site to retrieve almost any customer data.

Description:
For more than five years, firewall vendors have been under persistent, cyclical struggle against a well-resourced and relentless China-based adversary that has expended considerable resources developing custom exploits and bespoke malware expressly for the purpose of compromising enterprise firewalls in customer environments. In this first-of-its-kind presentation, Andrew Brandt will walk attendees through the complete history of the campaign, detailing the full scope of attacks and the countermeasures one firewall vendor developed to derail the threat actors, including detail into the exploits targeting specific firewalls, and malware deployed inside the firewalls as a result of these attacks. 

Fundamental to this presentation is the fact that the adversary behind this campaign has not targeted only one firewall vendor: Most of the large network security providers in the industry have been targeted multiple times, using many of the same tactics and tools. So this serves not merely as a warning to the entire security industry, but as an urgent call to the companies that make up this industry to collectively combat this ongoing problem. Because at the end of the day, we all face the same threat, and we cannot hope to withstand the tempo and volume of these attacks alone. We must work together.

Description:
This workshop is for SOC analysts, threat hunters, and defenders dealing with alert fatigue, fragmented telemetry, and the challenge of spotting coordinated attacks. Instead of large language models or costly vendor tools, weâll use open-source, explainable ML to map alerts, logs, and events into contextualized attack stories.

Attendees will work hands-on with real-world-style data to find root causes, build kill chains, and generate actionable ticketsâFalse Positive, Incident, and Attack Storyâthat mirror real SOC workflows. Weâll use the Attack Flow Detector tool, which runs in Google Colabâno install needed.

No data science experience required. The class is technical but beginner-friendly, with guided exercises and examples. Basic knowledge of logs and MITRE ATT\&CK helps but isnât required. The focus is on outcomes: understanding what happened, why, and how to respondâwithout black-box AI or complex queries.

By the end, students will know how to clean noisy data, map alerts to attacker techniques, cluster related events, and build end-to-end attack narratives. All tools and content are open-source, transparent, and ready to use in real environments.

Description:
Assembly language has a reputation for being intimidating, but once you learn the basics--and know how to read the documentation for the rest--you can easily pick up the rest. There are many interesting fields of study in computer security that depend on the "closer to the metal" knowledge you'll gain from learning to code in assembly:


Software reverse engineering
Vulnerability and exploit research
Malware/implant development
Digital forensics


...among others. There is no substitute for the confidence that you gain from being able to research and understand computer systems at lower levels of abstraction.

The purpose of this workshop is to introduce Intel x64 architecture and assembly language to the attendees. We will be using the Microsoft Macro Assembler, and we will be examining our code step-by-step in the x64dbg debugger. No prior programming experience is required--we will be working on things from first principles. There will be few slides. This is a new version of the workshop that makes better use of the x64dbg debugger to illustrate concepts of the class, live. Attendees can follow along with their own laptops and programming environments.

Description:
Ever wanted to tinker with a real industrial controller without risking a plant meltdown? In this workshop, you'll get to play in a PLC playground using actual industrial control hardware like the MicroLogix 1100 PLC that simulates physical processes like a fluid tank and a garage door. Guided by ladder logic programming and Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) tuning exercises, you will program the PLC to maintain tank levels and move machines, observing how the control system responds in real-time.

This workshop focuses on directly interacting with and exploiting the physical PLC hardware and its underlying protocols with a hardware-in-the-loop setup that includes an HMI. Participants won't just click buttons. They'll write ladder logic, interact with real I/O, and observe how PLCs process and respond to industrial inputs in real-time. Along the way, we'll highlight common ICS quirks and vulnerabilities (from insecure protocols to "insecure by design" logic) that can make these systems a hacker's playground. The Hardware In the Loop Industrial Control System (HILICS) kits used in this workshop are an open-source project that was designed and built by the Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) to provide a safe, scalable platform for exploring the cyber-physical dynamics of ICS environments.

Description:
DLL Loading is one of the most important parts of the Windows system. When you install, run, use, or hack a system, you will always use DLL. This DLL mechanism has been exploited for several years for malware development through several techniques : DLL injection, Reflective DLL but do you really know how Windows is loading a DLL ? The sections used, the internal structures and how the dependencies are resolved. Are you able to design your own Perfect DLL Loader that fully integrate with the WIN32API?
In this workshop, you will dive into the Windows DLL mechanism to understand how all of it works internally. With a decompiler, trial and errors, step by step, you will build your own (almost) Perfect DLL loader.
You will try to load from the simple AMSI.DLL to the most complex WINHTTP.DLL. At each step, you will dive deeper into the Windows Internals.
Malware developers, you will be able to use this code as a PE loader that never failed me for the last years and a DLL loader that does not raise the LoadImage kernel callback you can use on your own C2 beacon.
WARNING: while this is a windows internal DISCOVERY course, it is still a HIGHLY TECHNICAL workshop. You should have some entry-level knowledge on Windows systems, C programing and reverse engineering to fully enjoy the workshop.

Description:
Prompt injection is an emerging and poorly standardized attack vector targeting large language model applications. Unlike traditional vulnerabilities, there is no universal testing methodology or tooling, making it difficult for penetration testers to assess the security posture of LLM-integrated systems. Matrix Prompt Injection Tool aims to fill this gap by automating the generation of diverse prompt injection payloads. [1] Dynamic Input Detection: MPIT scans target websites to identify expected input fields where LLMs might process user requests. [2] Payload Enrichment: Each pattern includes crafted elements such as exploit strings, delimiters, and reasoning cues, enhancing the quality of the penetration test. [3] Genetic Algorithm Optimization: The tool employs a genetic algorithm to evolve and refine injection patterns, increasing their success rate significantly across different LLM defenses. [4] Practical Utility for Pentesters: MPIT is designed to support real-world offensive security assessments, making LLM-targeted testing more feasible and effective. ShinoLLMApps is a collection of vulnerable LLM web applications that use RAG and tools to help you test MPIT and better understand prompt injection and its risks.

Apple Find My is a crowdsourced offline tracking network designed to assist in recovering lost devices while maintaining privacy. By leveraging over a billion active Apple devices, it has become the world's largest device-locating network. While prior research has demonstrated the possibility of creating DIY trackers that attach to the Find My network, they are mainly for personal use and do not pose a threat for remote attacks. Recently, we found an implementation error in the Find My network that makes it vulnerable to brute-force and rainbow table attacks. With a cost of a few US dollars, the exploit turns computers into trackers without requiring root privileges. We are concerned that adversaries and intelligence agencies would find this exploit handy for user profiling, surveillance, and stalking. This demo is especially appealing to those interested in Find My network and Bluetooth tracking technologies. We will review how Find My offline finding works, elaborate in detail about our discoveries, techniques to make practical attacks, and provide source code for fun.

AdemÃ¡s, cada paso del juego serÃ¡ comentado y relacionado con tÃ©cnicas reales de respuesta ante incidentes, controles de seguridad, y procesos de detecciÃ³n y mitigaciÃ³n utilizados en entornos profesionales.x000D
x000D
El objetivo principal de este taller es fortalecer la capacidad de anÃ¡lisis, colaboraciÃ³n y toma de decisiones bajo presiÃ³n. Los asistentes no solo aprenderÃ¡n a detectar vectores de ataque, sino tambiÃ©n a emplear herramientas forenses, aplicar medidas de contenciÃ³n y erradicaciÃ³n, y comunicar de forma efectiva sus hallazgos y acciones. La sesiÃ³n estÃ¡ pensada tanto para equipos SOC, analistas de seguridad, estudiantes y profesionales de ciberseguridad, como para cualquier persona interesada en mejorar sus habilidades prÃ¡cticas de respuesta a incidentes.x000D

Description:
The rapid advancement of deepfake technology, powered by generative adversarial networks (GANs), has revolutionized creative industries but poses significant challenges to global financial security through identity fraud. This study examines the legal and regulatory frameworks addressing deepfake-enabled financial crimes in the UK, EU, and Asia, highlighting the growing sophistication of such fraud, exemplified by a 2024 case in Hong Kong where cybercriminals used deepfake video conferencing to defraud a multinational company of $25 million. Employing a comparative legal analysis and case study approach, this research evaluates the effectiveness of existing regulations, identifies enforcement challenges, and analyzes real-world cases to expose legal gaps. Findings reveal that while China has implemented specific deepfake regulations, the UK, EU, and Hong Kong rely on broader fraud and data protection laws, lacking targeted provisions. These inconsistencies hinder prosecution and cross-jurisdictional cooperation. The study proposes balanced regulatory strategies to combat deepfake-enabled financial fraud while fostering AI innovation, offering critical insights for policymakers, legal practitioners, and financial institutions navigating this evolving threat landscape.

Description:
Imagine this: You log into your favourite website, confident that Chromeâs latest security enhancements like tightened cookie access controls and session isolation are keeping you safe. But behind the scenes, cybercriminals are pulling off a high-stakes digital heist, quietly hijacking your login sessions without ever touching your password. In this deep dive into the high-stakes game of cybersecurity cat-and-mouse, we uncover how modern infostealers like RedLine, Raccoon Stealer, Vidar, and LummaC2 are actively bypassing Chromeâs newest defenses. These stealthy, modular tools are engineered to extract session cookies directly from memory or browser storage granting attackers full, persistent access to user accounts by impersonating valid sessions. This isn't just theoretical: threat actors are leveraging these tools at scale, using advanced evasion techniques like in-memory execution, DLL injection, and encrypted C2 channels to slip past traditional defenses. Meanwhile, a thriving underground economy continues to monetize stolen digital identities, turning session cookies into instant access to email, banking, cloud dashboards, and more. What weâre witnessing isnât just technical innovation itâs a fast-moving arms race shaping the future of browser security, session management, and digital trust. Donât miss how this evolving threat landscape is redefining what it means to stay secure onlineâand the critical steps defenders need to take to stay ahead.

Inspired by the popular container sidecar pattern, this talk demonstrates a generic, open source NixOS module that brings the same security and isolation to bare metal services. Weâll explore how to declaratively wrap any systemd service, placing it in an isolated network namespace with its own mesh network client (e.g., Tailscale or Netbird). This approach makes services securely accessible on your mesh, fully firewalled from the hostâno application changes required. Good fit for folks exploring declarative infrastructure and looking for practical ways to apply modern security patterns to their own servers.

Description:
The Pall Mall Process is a multilateral initiative led by the UK and France to address the proliferation and misuse of commercial cyber intrusion capabilities (CCICs) - but what that means in practice is that theyâre writing rules for hackers, security researchers, and the companies that employ them. The process recently concluded a Code of Practice for States, and is turning to the question of: what responsibility does the hacking and cybersecurity industry bear?

Join the Hacking Policy Council (a coalition of offensive security practitioners, platforms, and vendors) and representatives of governments convening the Pall Mall Process to discuss what a Code of Practice for Industry could look like, and how to ensure that it protects good faith hackers and researchers. Weâre tackling big questions: Should companies share zero-days with governments, and when? What makes a bug bounty âgood faithâ? How do we keep research ethical without strangling it with red tape?

We will give hackers a behind-the-scenes look at the policy debates shaping global cybersecurity norms, share our thinking, and invite critique, chaos, or consensus from the DEF CON community. Whether youâre a red teamer, researcher, builder, or breaker - join the policy hackers to share how you think we should make (or break) this code.

Description:
Discovering subdomains is an important practical skill and the first step in attack surface management. Solutions that are both comprehensive and fast (âfind ALL the subdomains and do it QUICKLY!â) are particularly prized. But like much of infosecâeasier said than done!x000D
x000D
Our team won the DEF CON 31 Recon-Aacharva subdomain challenge and our passion for Reconnaissance drove us to go further. A post-hoc review identified an alternative approach that yielded 100 times more raw domains than our original winning submission, and that approach took just a couple of hours. The key? Rather than relying on the open source âsubfinderâ tool, we used a passive DNS tool that returned only RRnames and RRtypes, along with relatively tight time fencing and parallel query streams. Enumerating subdomains that way is a straightforward taskâbut thereâs a catch!x000D
x000D
The real challenge for accurate enumeration turns out to be excluding DNS wildcardsâdomains that will resolve any arbitrary hostname, even random gibberish. For example, âaiuojad.tumblr.comâ resolves because tumblr.com is a DNS wildcard. Typical DNS wildcards usually arise at the 2nd-level, and even some entire TLDs (such as .ph) are wildcarded. Whatâs less-well known is that âdeepâ wildcards also exist further left in the FQDN, or exist only for specific RRtypes. While obscure, deep wildcards are surprisingly prevalent and exploitable for reflective DDoS purposes. While they can be used carefully for legitimate objectives, they can also devolve into abusable nuisances, capable of producing large volumes of cache-defeating response traffic when hit with spoofed/randomized DNS queries. They can even be abused to make it appear that a benign site has CSAM content or supports terrorism, etc., since arbitrary queries for such labels will find their way into the passive DNS record for all to see.x000D
x000D
If your site has any deep wildcards, they add an attack surface exposure you may not have been aware of; we recommend reconsidering the need for the wildcards and if they are truly necessary, carefully monitoring how those names are getting (ab)used. Our presentation demonstrates some methods for efficiently assessing a domainâs DNS wildcard status, and suggests a new âstandard of careâ for routine testing and logging of the wildcard status of ALL (FQDN, RRtype) combinations, much as you might log, geolocate, and port scan IPs you interact with. Join us as we share the technique that yielded more than 100x the number of subdomains we found in our winning entry.x000D

Description:
This session explores advanced security mechanisms implemented by major browsers to prevent cookie theft from their storage databases. Chrome has recently implemented AppBound encryption, which provides multi-layered protection for session cookies:

1) A 2-way DPAPI encryption system that operates with both elevated NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM permissions and normal user-level decryption capabilities;

2) A state-key encryption layer utilizing the ChaCha20Poly1305 algorithm with custom keys (that once was AES-256-GCM encrypted);

These implementations have significantly reduced the effectiveness of info-stealing malware. However, this session will demonstrate potential vulnerabilities in these security measures and explain how to obtain decrypted cookies despite these protections. We will examine the new format specifications and encryption methodologies for cookies.

Beyond Chromium-based browsers, we'll explore Gecko's encryption algorithms, which involve structured ASN.1 data formats with multiple encryption schemes including 3DES and AES-256. We'll also analyze Chromium on macOS which relies on PBKDF2 key derivation, and WebKit-based browsers that store cookies in binary cookie files.

Additionally, we'll discuss Chrome's forthcoming "Device Bound Session Cookies" (DBSC) technology, which aims to further mitigate session hijacking through cookie theft by implementing TPM chip-based encryption and requiring proof of possession of the cryptographic key.

This panel features several researchers that were central to the TTBR as well as the similar Ohio EVEREST Study and will delve further into the conduct of those studies, and how they may inform election security research today.

Speakers:Debra Bowen, The Honorable,Sandy Clark,Candice Hoke,Matt Blaze

SpeakerBio:  Debra Bowen, The Honorable
Debra Bowen was the elected Secretary of State of California for two terms from 2007 to 2015. Prior to that, from 1992 to 2006, she had been a member of the California Assembly and then the Senate.  In 2007, at the beginning of her term as Secretary of State, she commissioned the Top to Bottom Review (TTBR) of voting systems used in California. The review involved top computer security researchers, attorneys, and accessibility experts, and provided the nation with an unprecedented view into the state of voting machines. The TTBR led to critical changes to improve Californiaâs elections and influenced other states to move away from the most insecure voting systems. In parallel she commissioned the Post Election Audit Standards Working Group (PEASWG), a group of experts charged with outlining standards for election auditing. From their report emerged the very first formal description of what came to be known as risk-limiting audits (RLAs), now widely viewed as the âgold standardâ of auditing techniques. RLAs make the notions of evidence-based elections and software independence, two of the fundamental pillars of election integrity, an achievable goal.For her âbold leadership and her steadfast resolve to protect the integrity of the voteâ she was honored with a 2008 Profile in Courage Award by the John F. Kennedy Presidential  Library and Museum.

Description:
Mobile Device Management (MDM) apps route all traffic through managed VPNs, blocking traditional API interception methods. This creates major blind spots during security testing of high-privilege mobile apps.

KnoxSpy is a purpose-built tool that overcomes this limitation using dynamic instrumentation with Frida. It hooks into the target appâs network libraries to intercept traffic before it enters the MDM tunnel and after it exits, enabling real-time inspection and modification of API calls.

KnoxSpy allows security professionals to test APIs without breaking the MDM tunnel or modifying device policies. Requests can also be modified and reinjected seamlessly through the appâs own network stack.

Used successfully in multiple real-world assessments, KnoxSpy has helped uncover critical vulnerabilities in MDM-protected apps. A live demo will showcase how KnoxSpy enables deeper visibility into secured environments.

Description:
In 2017, hackers breached a casinoâs network by pivoting through their internet connected fish tank sensor, stealing the customer's sensitive data. This multi-million dollar breach exposed core IoT pitfalls such as default credentials, flat networks that allow lateral movement, and insecure supply chains. This is the reality of unvetted IoT integrations, a single device can open up additional attack surfaces and become your weakest link. Yet enterprises keep deploying third-party IoT gear for efficiency often without thorough security reviews. In this talk, weâll map the attack tree and uncover risks from hardware tampering, insecure protocols, cloud/API flaws, and supply-chain attacks. Then weâll share a four phase shift-left process to bake in security from day one (1) Scope & threat modeling, (2) Vendor audits, (3) Device attestation, (4) Secure integration, so defenses align with attack vectors, turning âplug-and-playâ into âplug-and-prove.â

Description:
Desktop applications are the forgotten attack surface of bug bounty hunting. They're usually out of scope, but they talk to assets that aren't. In this talk, I'll share how I've earned bounties by targeting desktop apps directly or leveraging them to find bugs in paying assets.

We'll start with traffic interception. Unlike browsers, desktop apps don't always like proxies. I'll walk through my bag of tricks for viewing and modifying traffic, revealing hidden APIs not exposed in the web interface, broken OAuth flows, and secrets leaking in requests.

Next item on the menu are binaries. This won't be a full-blown reverse engineering course, but I'll show how tools like Ghidra, dnSpy, and even strings have helped me extract secrets from binaries, bypass client-side checks, and uncover logic flaws. We'll also look at how Process Monitor has helped me observe app behavior and uncover where secrets are stored.

Finally, I'll build on my previous DEF CON village talk about jumping the browser sandbox, sharing my now disclosed bugs in protocol handlers and local HTTP servers that led to five-figure bounties.

If you've been ignoring desktop apps in your bounty hunting, this talk might change your mindâand your bank account.

Description:
In every modern Azure environment, Service Principals drive automation and integration. Yet, to support enterprise solutions in identity governance, cloud security, and DevOps automation, these principals are often endowed with broad Microsoft Graph API permissionsâsuch as RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory, Application.ReadWrite.All, AppRoleAssignment.ReadWrite.All, and ServicePrincipalEndpoint.ReadWrite.All. Even Entra ID roles that are not typically classified as âprivilegedâ can be exploited, enabling attackers to modify Service Principal configurations and escalate privileges in unexpected ways.
This session reveals groundbreaking research that uncovers how excessive Graph API permissions and the abuse of nonâprivileged Entra ID roles create new exploitation pathways in Azure. We will detail common misconfigurations that, when left unmonitored, allow attackers to seize control of Service Principals and manipulate application configurations. In doing so, we introduce Azure AppHunterâa novel openâsource tool that scans Azure environments for Service Principals with dangerous permissions and maps out potential attack vectors.
Attendees will gain practical techniques for detecting and mitigating these vulnerabilities, enforce least privilege, and integrate continuous auditing into their security workflowsâall essential for securing Azure deployments against emerging threats.

Description:
Gaining initial access to an intranet is one of the most challenging parts of red teaming. If an attack chain is intercepted by an incident response team, the entire operation must be restarted. In this talk, we introduce a technique for gaining initial access to an intranet that does not involve phishing, exploiting public-facing applications, or having a valid account. Instead, we leverage the use of stateless tunnels, such as GRE and VxLAN, which are widely used by companies like Cloudflare and Amazon. This technique affects not only Cloudflare's customers but also other companies.

Additionally, we will share evasion techniques that take advantage of company intranets that do not implement source IP filtering, preventing IR teams from intercepting the full attack chain. Red teamers could confidently perform password spraying within an internal network without worrying about losing a compromised foothold. Also, we will reveal a nightmare of VxLAN in Linux Kernel and RouterOS. This affects many companies, including ISPs. This feature is enabled by default and allows anyone to hijack the entire tunnel, granting intranet access, even if the VxLAN is configured on a private IP interface through an encrypted tunnel. What's worse, RouterOS users cannot disable this feature. This problem can be triggered simply by following the basic VxLAN official tutorial. Furthermore, if the tunnel runs routing protocols like BGP or OSPF, it can lead to the hijacking of internal IPs, which could result in domain compromises. We will demonstrate the attack vectors that red teamers can exploit after hijacking a tunnel or compromising a router by manipulating the routing protocols.

Lastly, we will conclude the presentation by showing how companies can mitigate these vulnerabilities. Red teamers can use these techniques and tools to scan targets and access company intranets. This approach opens new avenues for further research.

I have seen discussions about source IP address spoofing with stateless tunnels, similar to research on CVE-2020-10136 which uses IPIP tunnels. However, this research omits the possibility of using stateless tunnels for initial access. The PoC only provides methods to launch DoS attacks such as UDP flooding, TCP SYN attacks, and ARP spoofing, which do not require a response. Notably, there is no method to find a stateless tunnel in previous research, making real-world attacks impractical.

Description:
With the commoditization of IoT surveillance technology, private and public entities alike have been rushing to put every facet of our lives under surveillance. Unfortunately, schools are no exception in the ongoing privacy race to the bottom. In this talk, we present our analysis of a popular line of IoT vape detectors marketed primarily to schools. Rey first learned of the existence of this device while he was a student in high school, scanning the local network during his lunch break. He became obsessed with the idea of reverse-engineering it, and a couple of years later he got an opportunity when a specimen appeared on eBay.

This talk will cover our journey of acquiring the device and doing a hardware teardown. Then, we'll talk about dumping the firmware, examining its behavior, and doing some light reverse-engineering to uncover some fun appsec vulnerabilities. We'll discuss implications of our findings on this particular series of devices, as well as on the ed-tech surveillance industry as a whole.

We will release a copy of the device filesystem, as well as our scripts for decrypting OEM firmware and packing custom firmware updates.

Description:
Organizations across industries rely on "locked down" operator workstations to protect critical systems, but how secure are they really? As a penetration tester, Iâve put these defenses to the test across multiple verticals, using only the tools and permissions available to a standard operator account and on that local machine. Time and time again, despite variations in vendor solutions and industry-specific constraints, I found common weaknesses that allowed me to break out, escalate privileges, and compromise the systemâoften without triggering alerts.

This talk dives into the recurring security flaws that make these workstations vulnerable, from misconfigurations and weak application controls to a commonly overlooked "living off the land" technique. Iâll walk through real-world breakout scenarios, demonstrating how attackers exploit these weaknesses. But itâs not just about breaking outâI'll also cover practical, vendor-agnostic defenses to harden operator workstations against these attacks. Whether youâre a defender, engineer, or just curious, youâll leave with a better understanding of the risks and how to make the attackers job that much harder.

When: Friday, Aug 8, 15:00 - 16:59 PDT
Where: LVCC West-Level 1-Exhibit Hall 4-Communities-C206 (OWASP Community) - Map

Description:
The OWASP Amass Project has become a foundational toolset for security researchers, bug bounty hunters, red teamers, and defenders who rely on automated reconnaissance and external asset discovery to map attack surfaces. With the release of Amass v5.0, the project has undergone a major architectural transformation centered around the Open Asset Model (OAM)âa structured property graph that defines how Internet-facing assets and their relationships are stored, analyzed, and queried.

This two-hour hands-on workshop, led by Jeff Foley, the projectâs founder and long-time maintainer, offers attendees a first look at Amass v5.0âs new intelligence collection engine, which seamlessly populates the Open Asset Model database during enumeration operations. The session will walk through how Amass collects and organizes OSINT from various sourcesâincluding DNS records, WHOIS/RDAP data, TLS certificates, and moreâand models the results as a dynamic graph of properties and relationships between discovered assets.

Participants will learn to use core Amass tools such as:

amass enum â for deep, recursive asset discovery using passive and active techniques

amass subs â for quick subdomain discovery from the Open Asset Model database

amass viz â to render interactive visualizations of asset relationships in the Open Asset Model

In addition to these staples, the workshop will introduce the new assoc tool, a powerful query interface designed to unlock the true potential of the Open Asset Model database. Built around a custom Triples query language, the assoc tool enables users to describe pathsâcalled association walksâthrough the asset graph, surfacing linked insights across related properties (e.g., domains associated with a network, IPs linked to DNS records, etc.). The language is inspired by RDF-style triples but optimized for simplicity and clarity in cybersecurity investigations.

Amass v5.0 also ships with completely refactored documentation, providing diagrams to help users understand the data types, their fields, and their associations within the OAM. This new documentation dramatically lowers the learning curve for users new to the Amass Project, making it easier to build mental models of how different types of Internet assets are discovered and interrelated.

This workshop will include a live walkthrough of setting up and running Amass v5.0, from enumeration to advanced queries. Participants will leave with hands-on experience using the full Amass suite, understanding how the Open Asset Model works under the hood, and writing association walk queries using Triples.

What to Expect:

Real-world reconnaissance examples using Amass against publicly available targets

Query design exercises with assoc to extract actionable intelligence

Tips for integrating Amass data into your own tooling and pipelines

Visual mapping of organizational assets using OAM and viz

Level: Intermediate
Some experience with OSINT tools, command-line interfaces, or network security is recommended but not required. The workshop is designed to be self-contained and accessible.

Attendees are encouraged to bring a laptop and follow along. Project contributors will be present throughout the session to provide hands-on support, answer questions, and help troubleshoot issues in real time, making this a highly interactive experience.

By the end of the session, participants will walk away with practical skills in reconnaissance, data extraction from structured asset models, and a solid understanding of how Amass v5.0 is redefining modern Internet-wide discovery.

Join us at DEF CON to explore the future of OSINT automation and asset intelligence with OWASP Amass!

What happens when a security professional tries to help a government fix its insecure software? In this talk, Iâll share my story: from writing a secure coding policy and offering it to the Canadian government, lobbying elected officials, contacting agencies like CRA about their poor security practicesâand being met with silence, deflection, or outright dismissal. I didnât stop there. I wrote public letters, went on podcasts, published on Risky Biz, even got interviewed by CBC. But the institutions in charge of protecting our data? Either silence or âNo comment, because security." This isnât just a rantâitâs a roadmap. Iâll show you the secure coding guideline I created (free to reuse), explain why governments need public-facing AppSec policies, and outline how we can push for secure-by-default practices as citizens, hackers, and builders. Because secure code isnât just for dev teamsâitâs for democracy, privacy, and public safety. Letâs make it law. Letâs make it public.

Zero Trust is a powerful conceptâbut when applied to certified avionics, it can become a safety hazard masquerading as a security control. This talk confronts the policy disconnect between modern cybersecurity mandates and the engineering realities of aircraft systems. Weâll explore how compliance-driven frameworks like NIST SP 800-207, when misapplied, introduce latency, complexity, and certification friction into environments where failure modes are measured in lives, not log files. Through real-world case studies, including GPS spoofing incidents and the F-35B ejection, weâll examine how policies intended to improve resilience can degrade mission assurance. Attendees will leave with a better understanding of where Zero Trust principles can improve aerospace security and where policy must adapt to the constraints of safety-critical design. If your compliance checklist doesnât include cognitive load, deterministic timing, or the cost of recertification, this talk is your turbulence warning.

Description:
This workshop will provide an in-depth, practical demonstration of how real-world Red Team operations are conducted, focusing on the physical aspect of intrusion. We will walk through the entire lifecycle of an engagement, from intelligence gathering and planning to execution and exfiltration.

Unlike operations in other regions, this case study is set in a Brazilian environment, where high crime rates, armed security, and unpredictable urban risks add a unique layer of complexity to physical Red Team engagements. Security personnel in Brazil often rely on physical force and firearms rather than solely procedural measures, making adversarial simulation far more challenging and dangerous.

This session aims to expose security professionals to the often-overlooked risks posed by hybrid attacks and demonstrate why organizationsâespecially in high-risk regionsâmust integrate physical security, cybersecurity, and situational awareness to build a comprehensive defense strategy against evolving threats.

Due to high crime rates and frequent security threats, Brazilian companies must adopt stricter policies and proactive security measures to mitigate risks. The increasing sophistication of both criminal organizations and Red Team adversaries forces companies to rethink their physical and cybersecurity defenses, imposing more restrictive controls, robust employee training, and continuous security assessments to ensure resilience against real-world hybrid threats.

Participants will gain insights into advanced Red Team techniques used to bypass security controls, leveraging real-world tactics such as social engineering, badge cloning, physical intrusion, and covert device placement, all while considering the unique security landscape of Brazil. Through a detailed case study, we will showcase how an operation successfully led to the extraction of a sensitive financial document and the installation of a rogue deviceâin an environment where the risk of exposure carries real-world consequences beyond mere detection.

Where: LVCC West-Level 2-W222-W223 (Voting Village Talks ) W222 - Map

Description:
Voting is complicated.  Vendors attempt to manage this complexity with complex voting systems made of bespoke software and hardware. Testing and certification provide at best some confidence that a voting system is properly designed; they are not capable of providing confidence any particular election outcome produced with that system is correct. In 2007 John Wack and I introduced the notion of software independence to refocus attention on the evidence produced by a voting system, instead of on the correctness of the voting system itself.  A voting system is software-independent if  "an undetected change or error in its software cannot cause an undetectable change or error in an election outcome.''  Software independence is mandated by the VVSG; all new federally-certified voting systems must now be software independent. In this talk I give some perspective on voting systems, with an emphasis on voting systems for U.S. elections, and on software independence.  Some areas for future research are also discussed.

SpeakerBio:  Ron Rivest, Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Dr. Ronald Rivest is an Institute Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and a member of MIT's Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and its Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. He is a cryptographer and computer scientist whose work has spanned the fields of algorithms and combinatorics, cryptography, machine learning, and election integrity. Along with Adi Shamir and Len Adleman, Rivest is one of the inventors of the RSA algorithm. He is also the inventor of the symmetric key encryption algorithms RC2, RC4, and RC5, and co-inventor of RC6. (RC stands for "Rivest Cipher".) He also devised the MD2, MD4, MD5 and MD6 cryptographic hash functions. Rivest's more recent research has been election security, based on the principle of software independence: that the security of elections should be founded on physical records, so that hidden changes to software used in voting systems cannot result in undetectable changes to election outcomes. His research in this area includes improving the robustness of mix networks in this application, the 2006 invention of the ThreeBallot paper ballot based end-to-end auditable voting system (which he released into public domain in the interest of promoting democracy), and the development of the Scantegrity security system for optical scan voting systems. He was a member of the Election Assistance Commission's Technical Guidelines Development Committee. He is a Member of the National Academy of Engineering, a Fellow of the ACM, and a Member, American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 2002, along with colleagues Shamir and Adleman, he was awarded the A. M. Turing Award.

Description:
The frequency of space missions has been increasing in recent years, raising concerns about security breaches and satellite cyber threats. Each space mission relies on highly specialized hardware and software components that communicate through dedicated protocols and standards developed for mission-specific purposes. Numerous potential failure points exist across both the space and ground segments, any of which could compromise mission integrity. Given the critical role that space-based infrastructure plays in modern society, every component involved in space missions should be recognized as part of critical infrastructure and afforded the highest level of security consideration.

This briefing highlights a subset of vulnerabilities that we identified within last couple of years across both ground-based systems and onboard spacecraft software. We will provide an in-depth analysis of our findings, demonstrating the impact of these vulnerabilities by showing our PoC exploits in actionâincluding their potential to grant unauthorized control over targeted spacecraft. Additionally, we will show demonstrations of the exploitation process, illustrating the real-world implications of these security flaws.

Description:
What happens when your AI-powered travel agent develops a case of Finding Nemo-level forgetfulness? In this talk, we dive into a real-world attack scenario where an AI agent's memory is subtly manipulated into believing that chartered flights are always free. By repeatedly reinforcing a false pricing rule, attackers can book luxury travel without ever swiping a card - essentially gaslighting the AI into bankrupting its own business.

We'll explore how this kind of memory injection works, why AI systems are especially vulnerable to it, and what this means for the security of LLM-integrated applications. Expect live demos, some hilarious (and horrifying) case studies, and practical takeaways on how to prevent your AI from becoming the most generous travel agent in history.

By the end of this session, you'll either be terrified of AI memory manipulation - or considering how to get yourself a free first-class ticket.

This talk will be focused on my personal journey from zero public speaking experience to delivering nine technical talks at international conferences in just one year. I'll share how I built confidence, overcame stage fright, and embraced my unique perspective to share knowledge and inspire others.

In this session, we'll explore the reasons behind women's underrepresentation at tech conferences, and provide practical tips on:

How to manage nervousness and overcome stage fright.
Preparing like a pro - build technical talks that resonate with diverse audiences.
Turning introverted traits into strength in public speaking

Whether youâre a first-time speaker or a seasoned pro, walk away with actionable tools to find  speaking opportunities, craft CFPs and deliver talks that leave a lasting impact.

BioCypher is a tool that will help with plasmid design  to embed cryptographic messages. As quantum computing threatens traditional encryption, itâs time to ditch silicon and embrace self-assembling biomolecular firewalls. DNA Origami Cryptography (DOC) uses viral scaffolds to create nanometer-scale encryption keys over 700 bits longâstrong enough to give Shorâs algorithm an existential crisis. Beyond brute-force resistance, DOC enables protein-binding steganography and multi-part message integrity, allowing encrypted communication through braille-like molecular folds. Whether securing classified data or encoding musical notes into microscopic strands, DOC offers a biological alternative to post-quantum doom. In this talk, weâll explore how molecular self-assembly is turning DNA into the hacker-proof cipher of the future, now introducing Biocypher! The rough demo awaits for all to use the tool and think about a bio-crypto-future!

Description:
Running parallel vulnerability submission programs - one paid, one unpaid - is like managing two restaurants with the same kitchen but different menus and expectations. Researchers have strong feelings on this topic but so do businesses operating and funding the programs. 

Through data and years of war stories as an owner of connected device programs, this talk exposes the reality of juggling paid bounty programs for product offerings against unpaid programs for operational infrastructure. You'll learn how we made business risk decisions to separate programs, why researchers creatively redefine scope to get paid, why your infrastructure VDP findings might be more critical than your bounty submissions, and how we built a unified process that keeps both programs running without descending into chaos. 

Bonus: Discover how we turned scope debates into a positive force that led us to hire our top 2 researchers, enforcement of new software quality practices, and measurable SDLC program improvements that reduced critical findings by 40% year-over-year.

Description:
This talk provides a deep dive into Edge Side Includes (ESI) Injection, focusing on real-world findings and advanced exploitation techniques discovered during extensive testing on a private bug bounty program. While often associated with caching servers, ESI can become a potent vulnerability when user input is improperly handled. I will begin by demonstrating how to identify and confirm ESI injection points, even when standard ESI tags are initially blocked by Web Application Firewalls (WAFs). Attendees will learn how leveraging ESI can allow attackers to bypass the httponly cookie flag. I will detail how this leads directly to high-impact account takeover scenarios that are typically impossible with client-side Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) alone. 

The presentation will reveal advanced techniques to overcome challenging scenarios. This includes exploiting ESI in endpoints with a Content-Type of application/json. I will also cover a unique case of exploiting ESI via a proxy endpoint by chaining it with an XSS vulnerability found on a whitelisted third-party domain. 

Finally, I will share insights into navigating the realities of bug bounty hunting, including identifying and exploiting re-introduced vulnerabilities, developing persistent bypasses against evolving WAF rules, and the critical role of collaboration in uncovering complex attack vectors. 

This is a highly technical talk aimed at attendees familiar with web vulnerabilities (like XSS) and concepts related to caching or CDNs. Basic knowledge of ESI syntax is helpful but not strictly required.

Description:
Cloud breaches leave footprints - can you track them?

In this hands-on workshop, participants will deploy and investigate a simulated breach inside pAWS: a purpose-built AWS lab environment designed to emulate a realistic small organization. Unlike typical labs with isolated services, pAWS models interconnected users, workloads, and data across departments like finance, marketing, and engineering - just like real cloud environments adversaries target.

The breach simulation goes beyond cloud. Participants will trace adversary activity spanning AWS, identity, endpoints, and network surfaces - including API abuse, privilege escalation, persistence via SSM, and data exfiltration - all correlated in Elastic Security using rich cross-domain telemetry.

Infrastructure is deployed via Terraform and Python with reusability baked in. No prior AWS setup required - weâll provide access to preconfigured Elastic environments.

Youâll walk away with:
- Practical experience emulating and investigating cloud-native attack paths
- A better understanding of how real attackers move through hybrid environments
- Open-source tooling to expand or reuse the lab post-workshop

Whether youâre in detection engineering, threat research, or purple teaming, pAWS delivers the full kill chain - with all the paw prints left behind. Come for the cloud, stay for the paw prints.

Description:
In the run up to Googleâs plans to dump 3rd party cookies, marketing firms (a $1.7 TRILLION dollar industry) were sent into a complete panic. These firms relied heavily on 3rd party cookies in order to better attribute CPM (cost per 1000 clicks) and how many of those clicks turned into sales. So advertisers could better study human behavior and trends in order to more effectively sell products. 

As a former Security Engineer at the Largest Independent Digital Marketing firm in the world, I had a unique view into the evils that these companies were developing in order to not only maintain a few into consumer trends but to increase these views, increase the invasiveness of these techniques, and increase the cooperation between all levels of the industry from display point (streaming service), device point (iPhone, TV), location points (via ISP), to sales point. 

This talk is a peek under the curtain for the server side data harvesting that agencies have developed, and how theyâve managed to twist this further invasion into so-called consumer protection and increased privacy.

Some people think the days of critical HTTP request smuggling attacks on hardened targets have passed. Unfortunately, this is an illusion propped up by wafer-thin mitigations that collapse as soon as you apply a little creativity.

In this session, I'll introduce multiple new classes of desync attack, enabling mass compromise of user credentials across hundreds of targets including tech giants, SaaS providers, and CDNs, with one unplanned collaboration yielding over $100,000 in bug bounties in two weeks.

I'll also share the research methodology and open-source toolkit that made this possible, replacing outdated probes with focused analysis that reveals each target's unique weak spots. This strategy creates an avalanche of desync research leads, yielding results ranging from entire new attack classes, down to exotic implementation flaws that dump server memory heartbleed-style. You'll witness attacks meticulously crafted from theoretical foundations alongside accidental exploits with a root cause so incomprehensible, the developers ended up even more confused than me. 

You'll leave this talk equipped with everything you need to join me in the desync research endgame: the mission to kill HTTP/1.

Description:
Delegated Managed Service Accounts (dMSA) are Microsoftâs shiny new addition to Active Directory in Windows Server 2025. Their primary goal was to improve the security of domain environments. As it turns out, that didnât go so well.

In this talk, we introduce BadSuccessor - an attack that abuses dMSAs to escalate privileges in Active Directory. Crucially, the attack works even if your domain doesnât use dMSAs at all.

Weâll demonstrate how a very common, and seemingly benign, permission in Active Directory can allow us to trick a Domain Controller into issuing a Kerberos ticket for any principal - including Domain Admins and Domain Controllers. Then weâll take it a step further, showing how the same technique can be used to obtain the NTLM hash of every user in the domain - without ever touching the domain controller. 

Weâll walk through how we found this attack, how it works, and its potential impact on AD environments

Description:
Bootkits and Rootkits represent some of the most complex and stealthy forms of malware, capable of achieving full system control before and after the OS is loaded. While often discussed in theory, their actual construction, interaction, and execution flow remain mostly hidden from public view. This talk sheds light on how these implants are built and how their components interact across boot stages and kernel space.

We'll explore the internals of a fully functional UEFI Bootkit and Kernel-mode Rootkit, examining their modular design, runtime interactions, and the mechanisms used to hook critical parts of the Windows boot chain. Attendees will see how these implants operate across pre-boot and post-boot phases, including early internet connectivity from firmware, dynamic payload delivery, runtime service hooking, deep kernel control, and advanced capabilities like hiding files, processes, and network activity, blocking traffic, capturing keystrokes, and maintaining command and control directly from kernel space.

Everything shown on stage will be yours to explore: a complete Bootkit and Rootkit framework, fully customizable and ready to simulate real threats, test defenses, or build something even stealthier.

Description:
Killnet built its reputation as a decentralized Russian hacktivist force - loud, chaotic, and conveniently aligned with Kremlin objectives. But under the surface, it was something else entirely: a centralized operation controlled by a small group, using noise and hate as cover.

This is the inside story of how a team of just nine people delivered a kill shot to destroy this illusion.

Through targeted investigation and direct engagement, we exposed Killnetâs critical weakness: a financial link to Solaris, at that time, one of Russiaâs largest dark web drug markets. By publicly tying their operations to organized cybercrime - we disrupted their narrative, broke internal trust, and triggered full collapse. The result? Loss of state support, severed financial channels, and a rapid implosion of the groupâs infrastructure.

Weâll walk through how we tracked Killnetâs leadership, exposed its frontman âKillMilk,â and uncovered the criminal network behind the public facade. Along the way, youâll get a firsthand look at the real tactics - OSINT, infiltration, pressure points - that brought down one of the most visible cyber collectives.

This isnât just a postmortem. Itâs a case study in strategic disruption, showing how small teams can go head-to-head with well-funded adversaries - and win.

Description:
When vulnerabilities are disclosed, security teams face the task of developing exploits to identify compromised assets. Public exploits arenâÃÃ´t always available, which is why teams scroll through hundreds of patches to identify the relevant one. Traditional methods like grepping might fasten the process, but mostly come out ineffective against modern codebases where context-aware analysis is required. We present PatchLeaks tool that transforms the messy patch analysis process into efficient vulnerability discovery. Unlike regex-based static analysis tools, it locates relevant patches with vulnerable code based on CVE id only, doesnâÃÃ´t require any rules, has ability to identify logical vulnerabilities, and analyzes even corrupt files.

Description:
In the 1960s, the United States launched a radio-based weather information system broadcasting over the VHF band, known as Weather Radio.

Over time, Weather Radio expanded to cover the entire US and incorporated digital information through the SAME (Specific Area Message Encoding) protocol, allowing receivers to filter alerts by location and type, among other features.

Eventually, both Weather Radio and the SAME protocol were adopted by countries like Canada and Mexico for their own public alerting systems.

In Mexico, this solution was integrated into the Mexican Seismic Alert System (SASMEX), which over 30 million people in central Mexico rely on to prepare for the regionâs frequent earthquakes.
While new alerting technologies have emerged, this system still broadcasts messages to millions of receivers across North America. But how reliable are the systems responsible for warning entire cities when they need to seek safety?

In this talk, we will explore the history and design of Weather Radio and the SAME protocol. Weâll examine how messages are transmitted and encoded through this technology, and how it was adapted in Mexico for SASMEX.

I will also share my personal experience building compatible receivers: from early curiosity-driven experiments to developing a receiver as part of my undergraduate thesis.

Weâll analyze how the simplicity, a key strength of these systems, also introduces certain risks, and how these kinds of trade-offs arise when balancing accessibility, interoperability, and security in the design of any system.

In particular, weâll explore a concerning aspect: how, with the right equipment, it is surprisingly easy for anyone to generate these alert signals, taking advantage of the open nature of the broadcasts and the lack of mechanisms to verify the origin of received messages.

Beyond the technical exploration, this talk is also a personal story of my multi-year journey into this topic, with the goal of inspiring others with what I consider to be the core of hacking: the curiosity to deeply understand how systems work, explore their boundaries, and share that knowledge.

When: Friday, Aug 8, 16:15 - 16:55 PDT

Description:
Threat intelligence reports from reputed parties contain a wealth of OSINT including threat actor details, campaign information, IOCs (indicators of compromise), and TTPs (Tactics, Techniques and Procedures). Such threat intelligence is predominantly consumed with a human in the loop due to several challenges posed: Threat intelligence is often in natural language and difficult to extract automatically; These reports may have incomplete information and may require synthesizing multiple reports to construct a better view of the attack; Some intelligence such as TTPs are often implicit in the report and requires language comprehension; Not all indicators in a report are malicious and further they could have different degrees of confidence on the level of maliciousness and what they define as malicious.x000D
x000D
The labor intensive manual process not only makes it difficult/error prone to identify actionable threat intelligence in the form of battlecards but also leave users vulnerable to mentioned attacks due to the increased time gap threat reports and manual extraction of intelligence. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that many similar threat reports with different pieces of intelligence scattered across reports especially for emerging attacks.x000D
x000D
We build an agentic system to automate the collection and synthesis of cyber threat intelligence from threat reports using LLM Agents and unsupervised machine learning techniques into battlecards. At a high-level, CTI-Agent first extracts threat actor, campaign, TTPs and IOCs from recently published threat reports from reputed parties using specially crafted prompts on LLMs (Large Language Models) as well as using regular expressions/known knowledge which we refer to as signature based techniques. The agent also generates concise summaries for each threat report using LLMs. After performing a round of validation, the agent uses the summaries and extracted intelligence to synthesize multiple reports together and provide a battlecard with easily digestible threat intelligence. The agent follows the proven ReAct (Reason Action) framework to plan tasks autonomously and achieve the final goal of producing accurate battlecards by reasoning and then acting (i.e. calling various tools) multiple times. We plan to share our experience and lessons learnt during the process of build the CTI-Agent.x000D

In this DEFCON talk, we explore a chilling new attack vector: sending SMS messages that appear to come from nowhere no sender, no trace. By exploiting IMSI disclosure, attackers can track and precisely target victims using rogue base stations and manipulated VoLTE traffic. These phantom SMS messages can be used for advanced phishing, surveillance, and covert disruption, turning a trusted communication channel into a dangerous weapon. The talk demonstrates how these attacks work in practice and highlights critical defenses to protect mobile users and networks.

Description:
Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) limit the "risk" of certifying that the wrong candidates won. There are RLA methods for almost every type of political election in the US, including plurality, multiwinner plurality, supermajority, and instant-runoff voting. The latest RLA methods make it practical to audit every contest in every election, even in large jurisdictions with hundreds of contests. RLAs can "tie a bow around" a well-run election that uses trustworthy, organized methods to record and store votes. They cannot magically make a poorly run election trustworthy any more than fastening your seatbelt after an accident will prevent injury. Applying RLA procedures to an untrustworthy vote record is "security theater" that does not limit the risk of certifying the wrong winners.

SpeakerBio:  Philip Stark, University of California at Berkeley
Philip B. Stark is Distinguished Professor of Statistics at the University of California, Berkeley, where he has served as department chair and associate dean. In 2007 he invented "risk-limiting audits" ("RLAs"), endorsed by the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine and the American Statistical Association, among others, and required or authorized by law in about 15 states. He designed and helped conduct the first dozen pilot RLAs, helped draft RLA legislation for several states, and has published open-source software to support RLAs. In 2012, he and David Wagner introduced "evidence-based elections," a paradigm for conducting demonstrably trustworthy elections. Stark has served on the Board of Advisors of the US Election Assistance Commission and its cybersecurity subcommittee, the Board of Directors of Verified Voting Foundation and the Election Integrity Foundation, and on the California Post Election Audit Standards Working Group. He has worked with the Secretaries of State of California, Colorado, and New Hampshire and numerous local election officials. Stark has testified about election integrity in state and federal courts and to legislators. He received the IEEE Cybersecurity Award for Practice, the UC Berkeley Chancellor's Award for Research in the Public Interest, and the John Gideon Award for Election Integrity. He is a fellow of the American Statistical Association and the Institute of Physics and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

The Moonlight Defender purple team exercise series provides a low-cost, modular, and scalable exercise framework for realistic space-cyber trainingâeven in environments with restricted access, limited visibility, and contested information flows.

Designed and run by The Aerospace Corporation, MITRE, and AFRL, these exercises integrate purple teaming methodologies, enabling offensive and defensive cyber operators to refine their Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) in a high-fidelity, live-fire setting.

Moonlight Defender 1 (MD1) leveraged the Moonlighter satellite and Aerospaceâs Dark Sky cyber range to train operators in adversarial emulation, space asset defense, and real-world cyber ops under extreme constraints. Building on this, Moonlight Defender 2 (MD2) introduced virtual satellite simulators, ICS/OT systems, and enterprise environments, pushing the limits of how we access and test cyber defenses in space-based systems.

These exercises broke down traditional silos and operationalized space hacking, proving that security through obscurity fails in space just as it does on Earth. Attendees will get a behind-the-scenes look at real-world space-cyber exercises, from attack chain development to defense strategy refinement, all within the context of operating under limited access and denied environments. Expect insights into methodologies, tools, lessons learned, and how the hacker community can shape the future of space-cyber operations.

I will demonstrate how itâs possible to approach the Web3 bug bounty ecosystem just by exploiting off-chain bugs and vulnerabilities in the JavaScript ecosystem. This talk will explore the current state of this field through real-world examples Iâve reported on bug bounty platforms, which contributed to my achieving the top 10 global rank on the HackenProof platform.

We'll begin with bugs I discovered in a JavaScript sandbox used by a Web3 social platform and a Web3 website. The first involved a misconfiguration of DOMPurify, where developers attempted to filter links. Iâll show how I exploited this by tricking DOMPurify into treating a malicious javascript: URI as a safe link. The talk will also cover a 0-day vulnerability I found in another sanitization library used within the sandbox.

The final two bypasses involve React's global ""is"" attribute. Although the developers had blocked this attribute due to its XSS potential, I will show how I bypassed the protection by exploiting a prototype pollution vulnerability in a library exposed inside the sandbox. This, combined with specific new gadgets inside React, allowed me to pass the is attribute and achieve XSS.

All of these issues could lead to account takeover and were classified as high severity. I will also discuss the broader impact of XSS vulnerabilities on Web3 platforms, particularly the risk posed when wallets are connected.

Description:
"Fuzzing" is an automated software testing technique essential for detecting security vulnerabilities, effectively identifying over 100,000 bugs across the industry. 

While fuzzing has proven effective in uncovering critical issues, software teams often face challenges when implementing the fuzzing process. Teams must spend significant time identifying targets for fuzzing and creating test harnesses with initial inputs. Finally, engineering teams must analyze and fix issues detected by fuzzing. 

We created an automated fuzzing solution that leverages LLMs for the codebase analysis to identify optimal fuzzing targets, generating precise fuzzing test harnesses and initial seed inputs. 

Our solution automates the reproduction of bugs discovered during fuzzing and generates patches for the affected code. 

We achieved significant improvements across all targeted areas, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating LLMs and automatic code analysis into the fuzzing process.

Description:
We will present a higher-level ârehostingâ approach to the emulation of embedded Linux systems. 

While most existing embedded Linux emulation frameworks work in userspace, we try not to touch userspace or modify a firmware image at all. Instead, we take a higher-level and somewhat âhybridâ approach, which involves building patched Linux kernels and using modified or custom QEMU machines. We do this to model the terrain of a system as closely as possible to that which a userspace firmware image expects, allowing userspace to run essentially unimpeded. 

This approach involves a considerable amount of reverse-engineering of userspace binaries and libraries, alongside poring over whatever GPL code we can find, in order to write kernel patches, dummy drivers and make QEMU changes âreactivelyâ. Our goal is to end up with a rehosting environment which, from the perspective of userspace, looks almost exactly like the real system.

Culture isnât just found in galleries or libraries - it lives in code, on screens, and sometimes, in the viruses that once infected our machines. Building a Malware Museum tells the story behind creating the worldâs first online Malware Museum and its evolution into the Museum of Malware Art in Helsinki.

Only we can save the culture of our time. And our culture is digital. Preserving digital culture is hard: Software rots. Hardware vanishes. File formats die. And some digital artifacts - like computer viruses - were never meant to survive.

Mikko Hypponen has been archiving malware since 1991, originally for research - but today, this collection also holds cultural value. These digital fossils now offer a glimpse into a forgotten world of underground creativity, early hacking culture, and unintended digital aesthetics. Thanks to modern emulation techniques, itâs now possible to safely relive how those early viruses looked, sounded, and behaved.

In November 2024, Mikko opened the world's first Museum of Malware Art, in Helsinki. This art museum features modern art commissioned from artists around the world, all inspired by malware or cyber attacks. 

This is a journey through preservation, nostalgia, and the art of archiving what was never meant to last. Because even malware is part of our history.

Smart home technology often comes with a hefty price tag, particularly for specialized devices like weather stations. So instead I did it myself, instead of buying an expensive 'smart' device, I integrated a conventional weather station into Home Assistant. With AI-powered assistance and "vibe coding" approach, even complex devices can be made smart. From sniffing device communications to getting Gemini to generate C++. With modern AI tools, empowering your existing "dumb" devices is more accessible and achievable than ever before, opening up a world of custom smart solutions without breaking the bank.

Description:
As part of their training and certifications, most professional mariners memorize the ânautical rules of the roadâ. The International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs), form the foundation of maritime safety by establishing predictable behaviors and shared responsibilities between vessels. This a system with built-in protection and fall-back plans, tried and tested over a long history. But for hackers or cyber defendersâwho might not know starboard from Starbucksâ understanding these norms may mean the difference between big effect or no effect. Our talk focuses on one memorable guideline that ship drivers often fall back on: Donât Turn To Port (unless youâre absolutely sure itâs safe). There is plenty of good research out there about how cyber-physical systems such as rudder angle controllers can be manipulated on manned and unmanned systems. There is good writing on the threats unique to maritime choke points. But agnostic to the location, why would cyber manipulation of a rudder to induce a port turn be worse than a starboard one? Our talk will touch briefly on how the rules influence legal liability for collisions at sea, and conclude with encouragement for people to learn the rules of the road and further their own journey in understanding the maritime profession.

From 17:30 to 18:10, Recon Village is hosting 'Jeff "caffix" Foley' to present 'Legal Entity-Driven Reconnaissance with OWASP Amass: Enhancing Bottom-Up Discovery Using RDAP', which is about 'Title: Legal Entity-Driven Reconnaissance with OWASP Amass: Enhancing Bottom-Up Discovery Using RDAP
Tags: Recon Village | Creator Talk/Panel
When: Friday, Aug 8, 17:30 - 18:10 PDT
Where: LVCC West-Level 1-Exhibit Hall 2-603 (Recon Village)-Talks Area - Map

Description:
The OWASP Amass Project has long been a staple in the open-source reconnaissance ecosystem, enabling security researchers, red teamers, and defenders to map attack surfaces through passive and active discovery techniques. Traditionally, tools like Amass have relied on DNS, certificate transparency logs, web scraping, and other data sources to infer the digital footprint of an organization. However, this approach often begins with known domains and struggles to comprehensively uncover the broader infrastructureâespecially when initial input is minimal or obfuscated.x000D
x000D
This talk introduces a major advancement in the Amass discovery model: leveraging legal entity information as a pivot point for infrastructure enumeration. By incorporating corporate legal names, the project now enables users to query the Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) for associated IP address ranges directly linked to specific organizations. This evolution allows for a powerful âoutside-in" discovery strategyâone that begins with an organizationâs registered presence in global ICANN records and regional internet registries (RIRs).x000D
x000D
We will walk through how this process functions end-to-end within Amass, including:x000D
x000D
How legal entity names are normalized, enriched, and used to perform RDAP queries across multiple registries.x000D
x000D
How this approach facilitates infrastructure discovery even when no initial domain names or IPs are known.x000D
x000D
Ways in which the newly discovered CIDRs and netblocks are fed into the broader Amass enumeration engine for DNS sweeps, and passive data correlation.x000D
x000D
Importantly, this capability allows researchers to identify internet-connected assets that might otherwise be missed through traditional meansâespecially helpful for uncovering legacy infrastructure, misconfigured services, and shadow IT. It also helps bypass the inefficiency of wide-scale internet scanning by using authoritative registry data as a precise targeting mechanism.x000D
x000D
This talk will include practical demonstrations of the feature in action, guidance on using it effectively in both red and blue team workflows, and a look at where the project is heading nextâincluding potential integrations with open corporate registries, LEI databases, and expanded RDAP coverage.x000D
x000D
Takeaways for Recon Village Attendees:x000D
x000D
Learn how legal entity metadata can be leveraged to scale reconnaissance beyond domains and WHOIS lookups.x000D
x000D
Gain an understanding of how RDAP reveals registered network ownership and how Amass now uses this for bottom-up discovery.x000D
x000D
See live examples of uncovering unknown IP ranges and infrastructure linked to an organizationâwithout scanning the full IPv4 space.x000D
x000D
Understand the implications of this technique for external asset management, third-party risk analysis, and adversarial recon.x000D
x000D
By advancing outside-in discovery with deeper legal and registration context, Amass continues to push the boundaries of OSINT toolingâbridging the gap between traditional internet reconnaissance and more strategic, organizationally-aware approaches to mapping the modern attack surface.

My work focuses on a holistic approach to health; moving the bodyâs natural energy into alignment with Earth and the seven chakras. I practice integrative wellness - honoring a person's emotional, mental, physical and spiritual well-being. I provide intuitive healing sessions and work with clients to relax the mind, increase body awareness and balance energy flow.

I also facilitate community wellness workshops, ceremonies and transformational group programs inviting participants to disconnect from their busy lives, turn inward and tap into the present to restore and maintain the bodyâs energetic balance and cultivate self-love, empowerment and sovereignty.

I inspire people to activate their highest potential in alignment with their wise hearts and to promote healing from within. I tailor my sessions to reflect this; using techniques from my healing disciplines as well as my love for Traditional Chinese Medicine, holistic aromatherapy, crystals and essential oils, tarot, animal medicine cards and a deep reverence for nature.

Nature is one of my greatest teachers. It constantly teaches me about grounding, stability, resilience, boundaries, growth, and stillness.

Description:
During World War II, the predecessor to the CIA, the Oï¬ce of Strategic Services, developed a framework for the French Resistance to identify vulnerabilities in key German defenses and infrastructure. The framework, titled âCARVERâ applies the following designations to enumerated components of complex systems: Criticality, Accessibility, Recuperability, Vulnerability, Eï¬ect, Recognizability. The same framework, viewed through a security framework, will highlight a systemâs strengths or weaknesses, depending on the analystâs tasking. The panel will follow this outline: overview of election integrity issues; history of carver analysis; the ranking matrix; why we chose the items as critical; ranking of each item; discussion of the final rankings; how to secure.

Description:
Welcome to the "AI Art Battle" Generative AI Art Contest!

This unique competition invites creative minds to dive into the world of artificial intelligence and art. The challenge is to craft the most imaginative prompts that will be used by generative AI models to create artwork.

Contestants will not be creating the art themselves; instead, they will focus on designing prompts for well-known topics that push the boundaries of creativity and innovation.

How It Works:

Select a Topic:

Contestants will choose from a list of random topics.

These could range from historical events, famous literary works, mythical creatures, futuristic landscapes, to iconic pop culture references.

Craft a Prompt:

Using their creativity, contestants will write a detailed prompt designed to guide AI models in generating original artwork. The prompts should be clear, imaginative, and offer enough detail to spark the AI's artistic capabilities.

Submission:

Each contestant will submit their prompt and the intended outcome.

AI Generation:

The submitted prompts will be fed into a generative AI art model, which will create corresponding artworks based on the prompts.

A random panel will determine who the winners are.

Participant Prerequisites


Smartphone or Laptop

This year we hope to hold a pre-qualifier to help shape the contest before going on stage.
